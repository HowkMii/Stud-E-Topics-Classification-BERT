"Just as the business of medicine was once considered outside the domain of the orthopedic surgeon, we report evidence that demonstrates these emerging applications of AI warrant ownership, leverage, and application by the orthopedic surgeon to better serve their patients and deliver optimal, value-based care.",ai
"Originally coined in the 1950s, the term â€œartificial intelligenceâ€‌ initially began as the simple theory of human intelligence being exhibited by machines.",ai
" In 1976, Jerrold S. Maxmen foretold that artificial intelligence (AI) would bring about the â€œpost-physician eraâ€‌ in the twenty-first century .",ai
" In todayâ€™s era of rapid technological advancement and exponential increases in extremely large data sets (â€œbig dataâ€‌), AI has transitioned from mere theory to tangible application on an unprecedented scale .",ai
" From evaluating extraordinarily large data sets in near real-time, autonomous driving cars and stream history-influenced video viewing recommendations (Netflix, Los Gatos, CA, USA), to online purchase recommendations, advertisements, and fraud detection (Amazon, Seattle,, WA, USA), AI has become fundamentally ingrained within many facets of society and often functions invisibly in the background of our personal electronic devices.",ai
"Considered a subset of AI, machine learning (ML) exhibits the experiential â€œlearningâ€‌ associated with human intelligence, while also having the capacity to learn and improve its analyses through the use of computational algorithms .",ai
"These algorithms use large sets of data inputs and outputs to recognize patterns and effectively â€œlearnâ€‌ in order to train the machine to make autonomous recommendations or decisions. After sufficient repetitions and modification of the algorithm, the machine becomes able to take an input and to predict an output.",ai
" Outputs are then compared with a set of known outcomes in order to judge the accuracy of the algorithm, which is then iteratively adjusted to perfect the ability to predict further outcomes .",ai
â€œDeep neural networksâ€‌ are more complex versions of these models that make use of hierarchical tiers to segregate and manage the final output. The network begins with an input tier that then progresses to a number of â€œhidden tiersâ€‌ that each respond to different features of the input .,ai
" These tiers allow for an increase in understanding as the input ascends â€œdeeper,â€‌ permitting the development of models without explicitly programmed directions . ",ai
"As the machine studies a specific concept on multiple tiers, the existing algorithm is then able to successively refine itself as new data is available. Similar to the way the human brain functions, the machine is able to make â€œneuronalâ€‌ connections from â€œdendriticâ€‌ connections on multiple hierarchical data levels. These networks have thus given rise to a new form of AI, known as â€œdeep learningâ€‌ ",ai
"The predictive abilities of ML are being increasingly applied in the field of healthcare. As a convergence between health and data sciences, ML models have been proposed and tested as potential solutions to a variety of issues involving diagnostic errors, treatment mistakes, workflow inefficiencies, and impediments to value-based care .",ai
" One prominently theorized application of automated machine learning involves the automation of â€œclicksâ€‌ in the electronic health record (EHR) to combat the â€œworld of shallow medicineâ€‌ we currently live in with â€œinsufficient time, insufficient context, and insufficient presence,â€‌ as Dr. Eric Topol has described .",ai
" Specifically, a single patient in the EHR is associated with approximately 32,000 discrete data elements for analysis, necessitating an AI-based algorithm to process patient data .",ai
" Presently, efforts to automate actions in the electronic medical record are limited due to regulated proprietary access issues. However, when the eventual automation capabilities are realized, AI offers physicians the gift of time to finally execute the tasks for which they were trained, and â€œto make healthcare human againâ€‌ .",ai
"In 2018, the Cleveland Clinicâ€™s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery established the Machine Learning Arthroplasty Laboratory (MLAL) in an effort to further the study of these seminal issues and assess the ability to apply machine learning to musculoskeletal medicine, specifically as it relates to patient-specific, value-based care and human mobility ",ai
These research efforts are laying the groundwork for the future design and application of increasingly accurate ML algorithms that may directly improve patient outcomes and the practice of orthopedics in general ,ai
"This review serves to stand on the shoulders of those coming before it and critically evaluate the literature published over the last 5 years regarding ML in the field of orthopedic surgery, as well as to address its impact on the future of medicine.",ai
"Although ML is relatively new to the field of orthopedic surgery, it is vital for tomorrowâ€™s orthopedic surgeons intending to practice in the future to be conscious of and fully understand ML and the paradigm shift it represents within medicine in the delivery of optimal care ",ai
" In 2018, Cabitza et al. conducted one of the first literature reviews of ML in orthopedics, demonstrating a 10-fold increase in ML publications over the previous two decades ",ai
" Many of these studies have very practical applications to orthopedics. For example, a study by Thong et al. created a collection of algorithms known as an â€œartificial neural networkâ€‌ (ANN) to optimize encoding-decoding of 3D spine model vectors for the automatic detection of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ",ai
" ANNs are modeled loosely after the human brain and designed to recognize patterns in order to generate an output. Using a specific type of ANN known as a stacked auto-encoder (SAE), the authors demonstrated the successful ability to cluster patients by deformity and simplify the complex nature of 3D spine models. With separate encoding and decoding stages, the SAE was able to learn the parameters needed to map an input vector from a latent representation, and to use that input vector to regenerate an output vector consisting of a 3D spine model ",ai
 Another study by Olczak et al. made use of an ANN trained to identify fractures from plain radiographic images ,ai
" The network was benchmarked against a gold standard for fractures that was created by reviewing each image in full resolution with its multiple views in addition to the radiologist report. All of their networks exhibited an accuracy of at least 90% in identifying laterality, body part, and exam view when compared with the â€œgold standardâ€‌ radiology report, as well as the interpretation of the image by two additional senior orthopedic surgeons. Possible implications of this kind of image-based analysis include improved ability to detect pathology, and the ability to identify orthopedic implants for the purpose of facilitating hardware removal and/or modular revision ",ai
" With the use of ML, a specific manufacturerâ€™s implant may be identified via a simple radiographic film, eliminating the costly impact of delays in care or misidentifications leading to lack of appropriate equipment during the operation, and potential complications imposed by work-around options ",ai
"In a different application, Shah et al. used a validated ML segmentation model to automate the measurement and segmentation of articular cartilage thickness (ACT) in healthy knees on MR images ",ai
The algorithm analyzed 3910 MRIs and accurately identified which pixels represented which tissue type. This demonstrated how ML could potentially be used as a tool for automated tracking of the impact of medical intervention on the progression of cartilage degeneration ,ai
"Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), Kruse et al. built 24 statistical models to apply ML principles to the prediction of hip fractures over time in 4722 women and 717 men with 5 years of follow-up ",ai
" The best â€œfemale modelâ€‌ performed with a test area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92, while the best â€œmale modelâ€‌ performed with a test AUC of 0.89. Identifying predictive factors such as bone mineral density, glucose measurements, and osteoarthritis diagnosis, the model demonstrated that ML can improve hip fracture prediction beyond logistic regression ",ai
"While many of these original ML applications in orthopedics focused primarily on imaging-based pathology detection and prediction, more current and advanced applications of these predictive models have become increasingly centered on outcome-based measures and patient-specific, value-based care models ",ai
" Recently, Haeberle et al. conducted a review of these more novel applications, specifically exploring imaging-based analyses, value-based payment models, and mobile health technologies in the setting of lower extremity arthroplasty ",ai
" Demonstrating the novelty and effectiveness of many of these models, this review concluded that the incorporation of ML is critical for orthopedic surgeons in order to elevate their level of care and advocate for their patients through alternative payment models and preoperative expectation management ",ai
" Specifically, with the advent of bundled care programs by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ML has been used to assess the financial feasibility of these models. After analyzing 98,562 patients from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database, Karnuta et al. found bundling hip fractures represented an unsustainable business model as the cost of delivering care was based on non-modifiable patient-specific factors ",ai
One of the first studies to apply these ML algorithms in orthopedics was that of Kuo et al. ,ai
" Using a model that produces multiple decision trees from randomly selected features known as a â€œrandom forest model,â€‌ they demonstrated the successful prediction of medical costs in 532 spinal fusion cases over the span of 3 years. With an accuracy of 84.30%, a sensitivity of 71.4%, a specificity of 92.2%, and an AUC of 0.904, the model showed promise in its ability to inform hospital strategy regarding financial management and decision-making. Navarro et al. took this a step further by using a similar model to explore the impact and predictive ability of patient-specific factors such as race, gender, age, and comorbidities on postoperative length of stay (LOS) and cost for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) ",ai
" Using 141,446 patients, they demonstrated that as patient complexity increased, cost incrementally increased in tiers of 3%, 10%, and 15% for moderate, major, and extreme mortality risks, respectively .",ai
"  Ramkumar et al. applied the same model to patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), demonstrating continued successful predictive ability with the same postoperative factors despite a different joint and a different operation ",ai
"By creating these more complex â€œdeep learningâ€‌ algorithms that are capable of unmonitored learning through multiple layers of connected â€œneurons,â€‌ Karnuta et al. built upon this work by comparing the performance of two different ANN designs (MLP and DenseNet) along with multiple techniques for modifying the two algorithms known as â€œregularizationâ€‌ techniques, in predicting outcomes for primary THA and TKA in 295,605 patients .",ai
" Demonstrating the DenseNet neural network modelâ€™s ability to achieve a higher AUC above 0.80, the study established important relationships to consider when choosing a specific model to predict surgical cost. ",ai
" The study was also one of the most comprehensive to date, validating ML as a valuable predictive tool beyond that of disease detection.",ai
These ANNs were created and specifically applied to THA and TKA to create dynamic models that proposed patient-specific payment models (PSPMs) that risk-stratified patients based on their preoperative complexity to support reimbursement commensurate with complexity. ,ai
"While quantifying global patient risk was previously based on individual experience and therefore non-quantifiable, Ramkumar et al. established risk increases of 2.5%, 8.9%, and 17.3% for moderate, major, and severe comorbidities in the primary THA population and risk increases of 2.0%, 21.8%, and 82.6% in the primary TKA population ",ai
"Armed with this data, a PSPM may be used to communicate case complexity to the payers, and reverse the narrative that THA or TKA are presently â€œmisvaluedâ€‌ commodities ",ai
" As an example of the application of such an algorithm, THA patients with extreme comorbidities and severity of illness incur $10,200 in additional costs (17.3% greater risk) over those with minor risk in the Medicare population. ",ai
" This analysis provides value-based insights and evidence-based support to inform and hopefully influence policy advocates and decision-makers to provide more equitable reimbursement via a patient-specific tiered bundled payment model. Moreover, such a patient-specific payment model (PSPM) provides surgeons the long-sought ability to prospectively characterize and quantify non-modifiable patient-level factors.",ai
"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been called â€œthe operation of the century,â€‌ because it can reliably restore quality of life, physical activity and function, and mobility, while improving overall health status, in part, by reducing obesity and the impact of diabetes mellitus ",ai
"However, the present bundled payment model that offers a singular fee for an entire episode of care remains agnostic to patient variation, and indirectly encourages exclusion of those patients with risk factors for potential complications and increased costs of care.",ai
" It incentivizes one of the healthiest patients, who in fact may demonstrate less overall benefit from THA.",ai
"In contrast, a PSPM informed by the ANN described above represents a dynamic framework which can be utilized by patient, surgeon, care coordinator, and administrator alike, anywhere in the world, to analyze relevant patient-specific data and obtain meaningful, evidence-based output assessing patientsâ€™ risk and profile for complications and increased costs.",ai
" In turn, reimbursement could be adjusted to more realistically account for the most costly care provided to medically or surgically complex patients and create an equitable, cost-sharing relationship between payer, patient, hospital, and surgeon.",ai
"As another example, Karhade et al. used ML to develop a preoperative algorithm for the prediction of postoperative opioid use following total hip arthroplasty ",ai
"Five algorithms analyzed 5507 patients, 345 of which had prolonged postoperative opioid use, and determined the predictive factors for prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions. The best model achieved fair discrimination (AUC of 0.77) and exhibited higher net benefit than the default strategies of changing management for all patients or no patients ",ai
"Once externally validated, this algorithm will allow clinicians to preoperatively identify specific THA patients at highest risk for developing postoperative opioid use dependence and alter their perioperative management, and hopefully outcome, accordingly.",ai
"In addition to these value-based payment and perioperative predictive models, ML is beginning to be used in clinical workflow to evolve our remote patient monitoring systems. ",ai
"Notably, a mobile and wearable knee technology has been developed (FocusMotion, Santa Monica, CA, USA) to create ML-driven recovery solutions that track and assess pre- and postoperative progress remotely ",ai
"With real-time, patient-specific feedback sent from a â€œsmartâ€‌ orthotic to a smartphone application, the surgeon is able to use movement data to monitor the patientâ€™s mobility and activity compliance.",ai
" The patient is then provided with an individually optimized interactive recovery platform, utilizing notifications and real-time feedback to encourage compliance, guiding them throughout each step of their personalized recovery process. ",ai
" Ramkumar et al. validated the feasibility of the remote patient monitoring (RPM) system by successfully capturing uninterrupted, passive data for mobility, knee range of motion, patient-reported outcome measures, opioid use, and home exercise program compliance in 25 patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis ",ai
" By establishing the ability to remotely acquire continuous data, the study introduces a scalable RPM system in orthopedics and challenges the current paradigm of capturing patient data only through standardized, geographically dependent, inefficient, and costly processes ",ai
"Recently, Bini et al. conducted a pilot study designed to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of coupling ML with these wearable technologies to predict outcomes of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) ",ai
"Wrist-based Fit Bit (FitBit, San Francisco, CA) activity trackers and Mio Activity Tracker (Mio Technology, Taipei, Taiwan) and the Lumo Run waist-based posture sensory (Lumo Bodytech, Mountain View, CA) were used to collect 3 million data points from 15 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA).",ai
" ML algorithms were then able to successfully cluster sensor data from as early as 11 days postoperatively into groups that correlated to 6-week patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) (Hip and Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey Physical Component Score). ",ai
 Bloomfield et al. also made use of a ML algorithm to successfully separate 68 postoperative unilateral TKA patients into clinically relevant groups based on wearable sensor-instrumented performance tests ,ai
". Using the instrumented timed-up-and-go test, a custom wearable system extracted 55 metrics for analysis that were separated by ML into functionally distinguished groups with significantly different test completion times.",ai
"  By identifying these different cohorts, functional outcomes and PROMs could potentially be predicted, and those patients destined for negative result could be identified early. Armed with this information, the surgeon could potentially intervene in a timely fashion in order to change the negative trajectory and improve the overall outcomes .",ai
"  In addition, this technology enables the surgeon to more carefully monitor patients postoperatively, potentially reducing the number of clinical visits and postoperative compilations, and also providing the means to harness the full potential of virtual medicine and remote patient monitoring ",ai
"As the availability of information grows and modern data science improves, predictive models relying on AI and ML will continue to be incorporated into the orthopedic care of our patients. ",ai
"With its large patient volumes, reliance on radiologic and imaging studies for diagnosis, and robust outcomes data-driven nature, orthopedics is poised to embrace and propagate transformative technological advancements in an increasingly value-based era of medicine.",ai
Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data.,ai
" In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention.",ai
" However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related, and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. ",ai
" Machine learning (ML) has recently received considerable attention for its ability to accurately predict a wide variety of complex phenomena. However, there is a growing realization that, in addition to predictions, ML models are capable of producing knowledge about domain relationships contained in data, often referred to as interpretations",ai
  Defining interpretable machine learning.,ai
" On its own, interpretability is a broad, poorly defined concept. Taken to its full generality, to interpret data means to extract information (of some form) from it.",ai
 The set of methods falling under this umbrella spans everything from designing an initial experiment to visualizing final results,ai
"interpretability is not substantially different from the established concepts of data science and applied statistics. Instead of general interpretability,",ai
. We define interpretable machine learning as the use of machine-learning models for the extraction of relevant knowledge about domain relationships contained in data. ,ai
 Accuracy. ,ai
"The information produced by an interpretation method should be faithful to the underlying process the practitioner is trying to understand. In the context of ML, there are two areas where errors can arise: when approximating the underlying data relationships with a model (predictive accuracy) and when approximating what the model has learned using an interpretation method (descriptive accuracy). ",ai
"For an interpretation to be trustworthy, one should try to maximize both of the accuracies. In cases where the accuracy is not very high, the resulting interpretations may still be useful. However, it is especially important to check their trustworthiness through external validation, such as running an additional experiment",ai
 Predictive accuracy.,ai
What is supervised learning?,ai
"Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.",ai
How supervised learning works,ai
"Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.",ai
Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression,ai
"Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.",ai
"Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.",ai
Supervised learning algorithms,ai
"Various algorithms and computation techniques are used in supervised machine learning processes. Below are brief explanations of some of the most commonly used learning methods, typically calculated through use of programs like R or Python",ai
Neural networks,ai
"Primarily leveraged for deep learning algorithms, neural networks process training data by mimicking the interconnectivity of the human brain through layers of nodes. Each node is made up of inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. If that output value exceeds a given threshold, it â€œfiresâ€‌ or activates the node, passing data to the next layer in the network. Neural networks learn this mapping function through supervised learning, adjusting based on the loss function through the process of gradient descent. When the cost function is at or near zero, we can be confident in the modelâ€™s accuracy to yield the correct answer.",ai
Naive Bayes,ai
"Naive Bayes is classification approach that adopts the principle of class conditional independence from the Bayes Theorem. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of another in the probability of a given outcome, and each predictor has an equal effect on that result. There are three types of Naأ¯ve Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Naأ¯ve Bayes, Bernoulli Naأ¯ve Bayes, and Gaussian Naأ¯ve Bayes. This technique is primarily used in text classification, spam identification, and recommendation systems.",ai
Linear regression,ai
"Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes. When there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable, it is known as simple linear regression. As the number of independent variables increases, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit, which is calculated through the method of least squares. However, unlike other regression models, this line is straight when plotted on a graph.",ai
Logistic regression,ai
"While linear regression is leveraged when dependent variables are continuous, logistical regression is selected when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning they have binary outputs, such as ""true"" and ""false"" or ""yes"" and ""no."" While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is mainly used to solve binary classification problems, such as spam identification.",ai
Support vector machine (SVM),ai
"A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, separating the classes of data points (e.g., oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.",ai
K-nearest neighbour,ai
"K-nearest neighbor, also known as the KNN algorithm, is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity and association to other available data. This algorithm assumes that similar data points can be found near each other. As a result, it seeks to calculate the distance between data points, usually through Euclidean distance, and then it assigns a category based on the most frequent category or average.",ai
"Its ease of use and low calculation time make it a preferred algorithm by data scientists, but as the test dataset grows, the processing time lengthens, making it less appealing for classification tasks. KNN is typically used for recommendation engines and image recognition.",ai
Random forest,ai
"Random forest is another flexible supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression purposes. The ""forest"" references a collection of uncorrelated decision trees, which are then merged together to reduce variance and create more accurate data predictions.",ai
Unsupervised vs. supervised vs. semi-supervised learning,ai
"Unsupervised machine learning and supervised machine learning are frequently discussed together. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. From that data, it discovers patterns that help solve for clustering or association problems. This is particularly useful when subject matter experts are unsure of common properties within a data set. Common clustering algorithms are hierarchical, k-means, and Gaussian mixture models.",ai
Semi-supervised learning occurs when only part of the given input data has been labeled. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning can be more appealing alternatives as it can be time-consuming and costly to rely on domain expertise to label data appropriately for supervised learning.,ai
"For a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out ""Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?""",ai
Supervised learning models can be used to build and advance a number of business applications,ai
"Image- and object-recognition: Supervised learning algorithms can be used to locate, isolate, and categorize objects out of videos or images, making them useful when applied to various computer vision techniques and imagery analysis.",ai
"Predictive analytics: A widespread use case for supervised learning models is in creating predictive analytics systems to provide deep insights into various business data points. This allows enterprises to anticipate certain results based on a given output variable, helping business leaders justify decisions or pivot for the benefit of the organization.",ai
"Customer sentiment analysis: Using supervised machine learning algorithms, organizations can extract and classify important pieces of information from large volumes of dataâ€”including context, emotion, and intentâ€”with very little human intervention. This can be incredibly useful when gaining a better understanding of customer interactions and can be used to improve brand engagement efforts.",ai
"Spam detection: Spam detection is another example of a supervised learning model. Using supervised classification algorithms, organizations can train databases to recognize patterns or anomalies in new data to organize spam and non-spam-related correspondences effectively.",ai
Challenges of supervised learning,ai
"Although supervised learning can offer businesses advantages, such as deep data insights and improved automation, there are some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. ",ai
Supervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.,ai
Training supervised learning models can be very time intensive.,ai
"Datasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.",ai
"Unlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.",ai
Supervised learning and IBM,ai
"Supervised learning models can be a valuable solution for eliminating manual classification work and for making future predictions based on labeled data. However, formatting your machine learning algorithms requires human knowledge and expertise to avoid overfitting data models.",ai
"IBM and its data science and AI teams have spent years perfecting the development and deployment of supervised learning models with numerous business use cases. With the help of powerful tools such as IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, organizations can create highly scalable machine learning models regardless of where their data lives, all while being supported by IBM's robust hybrid multicloud environment.",ai

"IBM and its data science and AI teams have spent years perfecting the development and deployment of supervised learning models with numerous business use cases. With the help of powerful tools such as IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, organizations can create highly scalable machine learning models regardless of where their data lives, all while being supported by IBM's robust hybrid multicloud environment.",ai
Labeled data,ai
" Data consisting of a set of training examples, where each example is a pair consisting of an input and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal, labels, etc)",ai
Classification,ai
" The goal is to predict discrete values, e.g. {1,0}, {True, False}, {spam, not spam}",ai
.Regression,ai
" The goal is to predict continuous values, e.g. home prices.",ai
Types of machine learning Algorithms,ai
There some variations of how to define the types of Machine Learning Algorithms ,ai
Supervised learning,ai
Unsupervised Learning,ai
Semi-supervised Learning,ai
Reinforcement Learning,ai
Supervised Learning,ai
"I like to think of supervised learning with the concept of function approximation, where basically we train an algorithm and in the end of the process we pick the function that best describes the input data, the one that for a given X makes the best estimation of y (X -> y). Most of the time we are not able to figure out the true function that always make the correct predictions and other reason is that the algorithm rely upon an assumption made by humans about how the computer should learn and this assumptions introduce a bias, Bias is topic Iâ€™ll explain in another post.",ai
Here the human experts acts as the teacher where we feed the computer with training data containing the input/predictors and we show it the correct answers (output) and from the data the computer should be able to learn the patterns.,ai
Supervised learning algorithms try to model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets.,ai
Predictive Model,ai
we have labeled data,ai
The main types of supervised learning problems include regression and classification problems,ai
Nearest Neighbor,ai
Naive Bayes,ai
Decision Trees,ai
Linear Regression,ai
Support Vector Machines (SVM),ai
Neural Networks,ai
Unsupervised Learning,ai
The computer is trained with unlabeled data.,ai
"Here thereâ€™s no teacher at all, actually the computer might be able to teach you new things after it learns patterns in data, these algorithms a particularly useful in cases where the human expert doesnâ€™t know what to look for in the data.",ai
"are the family of machine learning algorithms which are mainly used in pattern detection and descriptive modeling. However, there are no output categories or labels here based on which the algorithm can try to model relationships. These algorithms try to use techniques on the input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, and summarize and group the data points which help in deriving meaningful insights and describe the data better to the users.",ai
Descriptive Model,ai
The main types of unsupervised learning algorithms include Clustering algorithms and Association rule learning algorithms.,ai
"k-means clustering, Association Rules",ai
Semi-supervised Learning,ai
"In the previous two types, either there are no labels for all the observation in the dataset or labels are present for all the observations. Semi-supervised learning falls in between these two. In many practical situations, the cost to label is quite high, since it requires skilled human experts to do that. So, in the absence of labels in the majority of the observations but present in few, semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building. These methods exploit the idea that even though the group memberships of the unlabeled data are unknown, this data carries important information about the group parameters.",ai
Reinforcement Learning,ai
"method aims at using observations gathered from the interaction with the environment to take actions that would maximize the reward or minimize the risk. Reinforcement learning algorithm (called the agent) continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. In the process, the agent learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states.",ai
"Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning, and thereby also a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its behavior; this is known as the reinforcement signal.",ai
"There are many different algorithms that tackle this issue. As a matter of fact, Reinforcement Learning is defined by a specific type of problem, and all its solutions are classed as Reinforcement Learning algorithms. In the problem, an agent is supposed decide the best action to select based on his current state. When this step is repeated, the problem is known as a Markov Decision Process.",ai
In order to produce intelligent programs (also called agents),ai
Input state is observed by the agent.,ai
Decision making function is used to make the agent perform an action.,ai
"After the action is performed, the agent receives reward or reinforcement from the environment.",ai
The state-action pair information about the reward is stored.,ai
Q-Learning,ai
Temporal Difference (TD),ai
Deep Adversarial Networks,ai
"Some applications of the reinforcement learning algorithms are computer played board games (Chess, Go), robotic hands, and self-driving cars.",ai
"There is possible to use different criteria to classify types of machine learning algorithms but I think using the learning task is great to visualize the big picture of ML and I believe according to your problem and the data you have in hand you can easily decide if you will use Supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. In the upcoming posts Iâ€™ll give more examples about each type of machine learning algorithms.",ai
Why is data preprocessing required?,ai
Data preprocessing,ai
Accurate data,ai
"For making the data readable for machine learning model, it needs to be accurate with no missing value, redundant or duplicate values.",ai
Trusted data,ai
 The updated data should be as accurate or trusted as possible.,ai
Understandable data,ai
The data updated needs to be interpreted correctly.,ai
"All in all, data preprocessing is important for the machine learning model to learn from such data which is correct in order to lead the model to the right predictions/outcomes.",ai
"Since data comes in various formats, let us discuss how different data types can be converted into a format that the ML model can read accurately. Let us see how to feed correct features from datasets ",ai
Missing values,ai
Outliers,ai
Overfitting,ai
Data with no numerical values,ai
Different date formats,ai
Missing values,ai
"Missing values are a common problem while dealing with data! The values can be missed because of various reasons such as human errors, mechanical errors, etc",ai
".Data cleansing is an  important step before you even begin the algorithmic trading process, which begins with historical data analysis for making the prediction model as accurate as possible.",ai
"Based on this prediction model you create the trading strategy. Hence, leaving missed values in the data set can wreak havoc by giving faulty predictive results that can lead to erroneous strategy creation and further the results can not be great to state the obvious.",ai
There are three techniques to solve the missing valuesâ€™ problem in order to find out the most accurate features,ai
Dropping,ai
Numerical imputation,ai
Categorical imputation,ai
Dropping,ai
Dropping is the most common method to take care of the missed values. Those rows in the data set or the entire columns with missed values are dropped in order to avoid errors to occur in data analysis.,ai
"There are some machines that are programmed to automatically drop the rows or columns that include missed values resulting in a reduced training size. Hence, the dropping can lead to a decrease in the model performance.",ai
"A simple solution for the problem of a decreased training size due to the dropping of values is to use imputation. We will discuss the interesting imputation methods further. In case of dropping, you can define a threshold to the machine.",ai
"For instance, the threshold can be anything. It can be 50%, 60% or 70% of the data. Let us take 60% in our example, which means that 60% of data with missing out values will be accepted by the model/algorithm as the training data set, bt the features with more than 60% missing values will be dropped.",ai
"For dropping the values, following ",ai
"By using the above Python codes, the missed values will be dropped and the machine learning model will learn on the rest of the data.",ai
Numerical imputation,ai
"The word imputation implies replacing the missing values with such a value that makes sense. And, numerical imputation is done in the data with numbers.",ai
"For instance, if there is a tabular data set with the number of stocks, commodities and derivatives traded in a month as the columns, it is better to replace the missed value with a â€œ0â€‌ than leaving them as it is.",ai
"With numerical imputation, the data size is preserved and hence, predictive models like linear regression can work better to predict in the most accurate manner.",ai
"A linear regression model can not work with missing values in the data set since it is biased toward the missed values and considers them â€œgood estimatesâ€‌. Also, the missed values can be replaced with the median of the columns since median values are not sensitive to outliers unlike averages of columns.",ai
Categorical imputation,ai
"This technique of imputation is nothing but replacing the missed values in the data with the one which occurs the maximum number of times in the column. But, in case there is no such value that occurs frequently or dominates the other values, then it is best to fill the same as â€œNANâ€‌.",ai
Outliers,ai
An outlier differs significantly from other values and is too distanced from the mean of the values. Such values that are considered outliers are usually due to some systematic errors or flaws.,ai
Overfitting,ai
"In both machine learning and statistics, overfitting occurs when the model fits the data too well or simply put when the model is too complex.",ai
Overfitting model learns the detail and noise in the training data to such an extent that it negatively impacts theperformance of the model on new data/test data.,ai
The overfitting problem can be solved by decreasing the number of features/inputs or by increasing the number of training examples to make the machine learning algorithms more generalised.,ai
The most common solution is regularisation in an overfitting case. Binning is the technique that helps with the regularisation of the data which also makes you lose some data every time you regularise it.,ai
Data with no numerical values,ai
"In the case of the data set with no numerical values, it becomes impossible for the machine learning model to learn the information.",ai
"The machine learning model can only handle numerical values and thus, it is best to spread the values in the columns with assigned binary numbers â€œ0â€‌ or â€œ1â€‌. This technique is known as one-hot encoding.",ai
"In this type of technique, the grouped columns already exist. For instance, below I have mentioned a grouped column:",ai
"Now, the above-grouped data can be encoded with the binary numbers â€‌0â€‌ and â€œ1â€‌ with one hot encoding technique. This technique subtly converts the categorical data into a numerical format ",ai
"Hence, it results in better handling of grouped data by converting the same into encoded data for the machine learning model to grasp the encoded (which is numerical) information quickly.",ai
"Going further, in case there are more than three categories in a data set that is to be used for feeding the machine learning model, the one-hot encoding technique will create as many columns. Let us say, there are 2000 categories, then this technique will create 2000 columns and it will be a lot of information to feed to the model.",ai
"simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users,",ai
"shorter training times, ",ai
"to avoid the curse of dimensionality, ",ai
"improve data's compatibility with a learning model class, ",ai
encode inherent symmetries present in the input space,ai
"The central premise when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains some features that are either redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information. ",ai
"Redundant and irrelevant are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated. ",ai
Feature selection techniques should be distinguished from feature extraction.,ai
"]Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples (or data points). Archetypal cases for the application of feature selection include the analysis of written texts and DNA microarray data, where there are many thousands of features, and a few tens to hundreds of samples.",ai
"A feature selection algorithm can be seen as the combination of a search technique for proposing new feature subsets, along with an evaluation measure which scores the different feature subsets. The simplest algorithm is to test each possible subset of features finding the one which minimizes the error rate. This is an exhaustive search of the space, and is computationally intractable for all but the smallest of feature sets. The choice of evaluation metric heavily influences the algorithm, and it is these evaluation metrics which distinguish between the three main categories of feature selection algorithms: wrappers, filters and embedded methods",ai
"Wrapper methods use a predictive model to score feature subsets. Each new subset is used to train a model, which is tested on a hold-out set. Counting the number of mistakes made on that hold-out set (the error rate of the model) gives the score for that subset.",ai
" As wrapper methods train a new model for each subset, they are very computationally intensive, but usually provide the best performing feature set for that particular type of model or typical problem.",ai
"Filter methods use a proxy measure instead of the error rate to score a feature subset. This measure is chosen to be fast to compute, while still capturing the usefulness of the feature set. Common measures include the mutual information,[10] the pointwise mutual information,[12]Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Relief-based algorithms,",ai
 and inter/intra class distance or the scores of significance tests for each class/feature combinations. ,ai
"Filters are usually less computationally intensive than wrappers, but they produce a feature set which is not tuned to a specific type of predictive model",ai
"This lack of tuning means a feature set from a filter is more general than the set from a wrapper, usually giving lower prediction performance than a wrapper.",ai
" However the feature set doesn't contain the assumptions of a prediction model, and so is more useful for exposing the relationships between the features.",ai
" Many filters provide a feature ranking rather than an explicit best feature subset, and the cut off point in the ranking is chosen via cross-validation.",ai
" Filter methods have also been used as a preprocessing step for wrapper methods, allowing a wrapper to be used on larger problems. One other popular approach is the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm commonly used with Support Vector Machines to repeatedly construct a model and remove features with low weights.",ai
Embedded methods are a catch-all group of techniques which perform feature selection as part of the model construction process.,ai
" The exemplar of this approach is the LASSO method for constructing a linear model, which penalizes the regression coefficients with an L1 penalty, shrinking many of them to zero. ",ai
Any features which have non-zero regression coefficients are 'selected' by the LASSO algorithm.,ai
 Improvements to the LASSO include Bolasso which bootstraps samples;,ai
" Elastic net regularization, which combines the L1 penalty of LASSO with the L2 penalty of ridge regression; and FeaLect which scores all the features based on combinatorial analysis of regression coefficients",ai
 AEFS further extends LASSO to nonlinear scenario with autoencoders.,ai
 These approaches tend to be between filters and wrappers in terms of computational complexity.,ai
"In traditional regression analysis,",ai
" the most popular form of feature selection is stepwise regression, which is a wrapper technique.",ai
 It is a greedy algorithm that adds the best feature (or deletes the worst feature) at each round. ,ai
"The main control issue is deciding when to stop the algorithm. In machine learning, this is typically done by cross-validation. ",ai
"In statistics, some criteria are optimized. This leads to the inherent problem of nesting. ",ai
"More robust methods have been explored, such as branch and bound and piecewise linear network.",ai
Subset selection evaluates a subset of features as a group for suitability.,ai
" Subset selection algorithms can be broken up into wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. ",ai
Wrappers use a search algorithm to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset by running a model on the subset.,ai
 Wrappers can be computationally expensive and have a risk of over fitting to the model. ,ai
"Filters are similar to wrappers in the search approach, but instead of evaluating against a model,",ai
 a simpler filter is evaluated.,ai
" Embedded techniques are embedded in, and specific to, a model.",ai
"Many popular search approaches use greedy hill climbing, which iteratively evaluates a candidate subset of features, ",ai
"then modifies the subset and evaluates if the new subset is an improvement over the old. Evaluation of the subsets requires a scoring metric that grades a subset of features. Exhaustive search is generally impractical, so at some implementor (or operator) defined stopping point, ",ai
the subset of features with the highest score discovered up to that point is selected as the satisfactory feature subset. ,ai
"The stopping criterion varies by algorithmpossible criteria include: a subset score exceeds a threshold, a program's maximum allowed run time has been surpassed, etc.",ai
Alternative search-based techniques are based on targeted projection pursuit which finds low-dimensional projections of the data that score highly: the features that have the largest projections in the lower-dimensional space are then selected,ai
How data splitting works,ai
"In a basic two-part data split, the training data set is used to train and develop models. ",ai
Training sets are commonly used to estimate different parameters or to compare different model performance.,ai
The testing data set is used after the training is done. ,ai
"The training and test data are compared to check that the final model works correctly. With machine learning, data is commonly split into three or more sets.",ai
" With three sets, the additional set is the dev set, which is used to change learning process parameters.",ai
There is no set guideline or metric for how the data should be split,ai
 it may depend on the size of the original data pool or the number of predictors in a predictive model. Organizations and data modelers may choose to separate split data based on data sampling methods,ai
Random sampling. ,ai
"This data sampling method protects the data modeling process from bias toward different possible data characteristics. However, random splitting may have issues regarding the uneven distribution of data",ai
Stratified random sampling. ,ai
This method selects data samples at random within specific parameters.,ai
 It ensures the data is correctly distributed in training and test sets.,ai
Nonrandom sampling. ,ai
This approach is typically used when data modelers want the most recent data as the test set.,ai
"With data splitting, organizations don't have to choose between using the data for analytics versus statistical analysis, since the same data can be used in the different processes.",ai
"Data sampling can either use a random, probability-based method or nonrandom approach.",ai
Common data splitting uses,ai
Data modeling,ai
" uses data splitting to train models. An example of this is in regression testing modeling, where a developer uses a model to predict a system's response when operated with made-up values. Using this set of values, the developer would select a portion of that data to act as the training data. Then, they would compare those results against the test data put through the regression model. This gives the developer a sense that the model is accurate.",ai
Machine learning ,ai
"also uses data splitting to train models. Training data is added to the model to update its training phase parameters. After the training phase is finished, the data from the test set is measured against how the model handles new observations.",ai
See how machine learning continually learns from existing data so that it knows what to do with new data.,ai
Cryptographic splitting,ai
" is a different process from the uses of data splitting mentioned above. It is a technique used to secure data over a computer network. Cryptographic splitting is meant to protect systems from security breaches and involves encrypting data, splitting the encrypted data into smaller pieces and storing those pieces in different storage locations. The data is further encrypted when stored in its new location.",ai
Data splitting in machine learning,ai
"In machine learning, data splitting is typically done to avoid overfitting. That is an instance where a machine learning model fits its training data too well and fails to reliably fit additional data.",ai
"The original data in a machine learning model is typically taken and split into three or four sets. The three sets commonly used are the training set, the dev set and the testing set",ai
The training ,ai
"set is the portion of data used to train the model. The model should observe and learn from the training set, optimizing any of its parameters.",ai
The dev set is a data set of examples used to change learning process parameters. It is also called the cross-validation or model validation set. This set of data has the goal of ranking the model's accuracy and can help with model selection,ai
The testing set ,ai
is the portion of data that is tested in the final model and is compared against the previous sets of data. The testing set acts as an evaluation of the final mode and algorithm.,ai
The Importance of Data Splitting,ai
"Supervised machine learning is about creating models that precisely map the given inputs (independent variables, or predictors) to the given outputs (dependent variables, or responses).",ai
How you measure the precision of your model depends on the type of a problem youâ€™re trying to solve.,ai
" In regression analysis, you typically use the coefficient of determination, root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, or similar quantities. For classification problems, you often apply accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and related indicators.",ai
"The acceptable numeric values that measure precision vary from field to field. You can find detailed explanations from Statistics By Jim, Quora, and many other resources.",ai
"Whatâ€™s most important to understand is that you usually need unbiased evaluation to properly use these measures, assess the predictive performance of your model, and validate the model.",ai
This means that you canâ€™t evaluate the predictive performance of a model with the same data you used for training. You need evaluate the model with fresh data that hasnâ€™t been seen by the model before.,ai
 You can accomplish that by splitting your dataset before you use it.,ai
"Training,",ai
 Validation,ai
and Test Sets,ai
Splitting your dataset is essential for an unbiased evaluation of prediction performance.,ai
" In most cases, itâ€™s enough to split your dataset randomly into three subsets",ai
"The training set is applied to train, or fit, your model. For example, you use the training set to find the optimal weights, or coefficients, for linear regression, logistic regression, or neural networks.",ai
"The validation set is used for unbiased model evaluation during hyperparameter tuning. For example, when you want to find the optimal number of neurons in a neural network or the best kernel for a support vector machine, you experiment with different values. For each considered setting of hyperparameters, you fit the model with the training set and assess its performance with the validation set.",ai
The test set is needed for an unbiased evaluation of the final model. You shouldnâ€™t use it for fitting or validation.,ai
"In less complex cases, when you donâ€™t have to tune hyperparameters, itâ€™s okay to work with only the training and test sets.",ai
Underfitting and Overfitting,ai
"Splitting a dataset might also be important for detecting if your model suffers from one of two very common problems, called underfitting and overfitting",ai
"Underfitting is usually the consequence of a model being unable to encapsulate the relations among data. For example, this can happen when trying to represent nonlinear relations with a linear model. Underfitted models will likely have poor performance with both training and test sets.",ai
"Overfitting usually takes place when a model has an excessively complex structure and learns both the existing relations among data and noise. Such models often have bad generalization capabilities. Although they work well with training data, they usually yield poor performance with unseen (test) data.",ai
You can find a more detailed explanation of underfitting and overfitting in Linear Regression in Python.,ai
Prerequisites for Using train,ai
test,ai
split(),ai
"Now that you understand the need to split a dataset in order to perform unbiased model evaluation and identify underfitting or overfitting, youâ€™re ready to learn how to split your own datasets.",ai
"Youâ€™ll also need NumPy, but you donâ€™t have to install it separately. You should get it along with sklearn if you donâ€™t already have it installed. If you want to refresh your NumPy knowledge, then take a look at the official documentation or check out Look Ma, No For-Loops: Array Programming With NumPy.",ai
Application of train,ai
test,ai
split(),ai
You need to import train,ai
test,ai
split() and NumPy before you can use them,ai
train,ai
"size is the number that defines the size of the training set. If you provide a float, then it must be between 0.0 and 1.0 and will define the share of the dataset used for testing. If you provide an int, then it will represent the total number of the training samples. The default value is None.",ai
test,ai
size is the number that defines the size of the test set. Itâ€™s very similar to train,ai
size. You should provide either train,ai
size or test,ai
"size. If neither is given, then the default share of the dataset that will be used for testing is 0.25, or 25 percent.",ai
random,ai
state is the object that controls randomization during splitting. It can be either an int or an instance of RandomState. The default value is None.,ai
shuffle is the Boolean object (True by default) that determines whether to shuffle the dataset before applying the split.,ai
"stratify is an array-like object that, if not None, determines how to use a stratified split.",ai
"You probably got different results from what you see here. This is because dataset splitting is random by default. The result differs each time you run the function. However, this often isnâ€™t what you want.",ai
"Sometimes, to make your tests reproducible, you need a random split with the same output for each function call. You can do that with the parameter random",ai
state. The value of random,ai
"state isnâ€™t importantâ€”it can be any non-negative integer. You could use an instance of numpy.random.RandomState instead, but that is a more complex approach.",ai
"In the previous example, you used a dataset with twelve observations (rows) and got a training sample with nine rows and a test sample with three rows. Thatâ€™s because you didnâ€™t specify the desired size of the training and test sets. By default, 25 percent of samples are assigned to the test set. This ratio is generally fine for many applications, but itâ€™s not always what you need.",ai
"Typically, youâ€™ll want to define the size of the test (or training) set explicitly, and sometimes youâ€™ll even want to experiment with different values. You can do that with the parameters train",ai
size or test,ai
size.,ai
"With this change, you get a different result from before. Earlier, you had a training set with nine items and test set with three items. Now, thanks to the argument test",ai
"size=4, the training set has eight items and the test set has four items. Youâ€™d get the same result with test",ai
size=0.33 because 33 percent of twelve is approximately four.,ai
Thereâ€™s one more very important difference between the last two examples: You now get the same result each time you run the function. This is because youâ€™ve fixed the random number generator with random,ai
state=4.,ai
The samples of the dataset are shuffled randomly and then split into the training and test sets according to the size you defined.,ai
"You can see that y has six zeros and six ones. However, the test set has three zeros out of four items. If you want to (approximately) keep the proportion of y values through the training and test sets, then pass stratify=y. This will enable stratified splitting",ai
Now y,ai
train and y,ai
test have the same ratio of zeros and ones as the original y array.,ai
"Stratified splits are desirable in some cases, like when youâ€™re classifying an imbalanced dataset, a dataset with a significant difference in the number of samples that belong to distinct classes.",ai
"Finally, you can turn off data shuffling and random split with shuffle=False",ai
Now you have a split in which the first two-thirds of samples in the original x and y arrays are assigned to the training set and the last third to the test set. No shuffling. No randomness.,ai
Supervised Machine Learning With train,ai
test,ai
split(),ai
Now itâ€™s time to see train,ai
test,ai
split() in action when solving supervised learning problems. Youâ€™ll start with a small regression problem that can be solved with linear regression before looking at a bigger problem. Youâ€™ll also see that you can use train,ai
test,ai
split() for classification as well.,ai
What is natural language processing?,ai
"Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer scienceâ€”and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AIâ€”concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.",ai
"NLP combines computational linguisticsâ€”rule-based modeling of human languageâ€”with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to â€کunderstandâ€™ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writerâ€™s intent and sentiment.",ai
"NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidlyâ€”even in real time. Thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.",ai
NLP tasks,ai
"Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data. Homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structureâ€”these just a few of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those applications are going to be useful.",ai
Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting. Some of these tasks ,ai
Speech recognition,ai
" also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data. Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions. What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talkâ€”quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.",ai
Part of speech tagging,ai
" also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies â€کmakeâ€™ as a verb in â€کI can make a paper plane,â€™ and as a noun in â€کWhat make of car do you own?â€™",ai
Word sense disambiguation ,ai
"is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings  through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context. For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb 'make' in â€کmake the gradeâ€™ (achieve) vs. â€کmake a betâ€™ (place).",ai
Named entity recognition,ai
" or NEM, identifies words or phrases as useful entities. NEM identifies â€کKentuckyâ€™ as a location or â€کFredâ€™ as a man's name.",ai
Co-reference resolution ,ai
"is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity. The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (e.g., â€کsheâ€™ = â€کMaryâ€™),  but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or an idiom in the text  (e.g., an instance in which 'bear' isn't an animal but a large hairy person).",ai
Sentiment analysis,ai
" attempts to extract subjective qualitiesâ€”attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicionâ€”from text.",ai
Natural language generation is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it's the task of putting structured information into human language. ,ai
NLP tools and approaches,ai
"The Python programing language provides a wide range of tools and libraries for attacking specific NLP tasks. Many of these are found in the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, an open source collection of libraries, programs, and education resources for building NLP programs.",ai
"The NLTK includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, plus libraries for subtasks, such as sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that help the computer better understand the text). It also includes libraries for implementing capabilities such as semantic reasoning, the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.",ai
"Statistical NLP, machine learning, and deep learning",ai
"The earliest NLP applications were hand-coded, rules-based systems that could perform certain NLP tasks, but couldn't easily scale to accommodate a seemingly endless stream of exceptions or the increasing volumes of text and voice data.",ai
"Enter statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements. Today, deep learning models and learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable NLP systems that 'learn' as they work and extract ever more accurate meaning from huge volumes of raw, unstructured, and unlabeled text and voice data sets. ",ai
"For a deeper dive into the nuances between these technologies and their learning approaches, see â€œAI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: Whatâ€™s the Difference?â€‌",ai
NLP use cases,ai
Natural language processing is the driving force behind machine intelligence in many modern real-world applications. ,ai
Spam detection,ai
"You may not think of spam detection as an NLP solution, but the best spam detection technologies use NLP's text classification capabilities to scan emails for language that often indicates spam or phishing. These indicators can include overuse of financial terms, characteristic bad grammar, threatening language, inappropriate urgency, misspelled company names, and more. Spam detection is one of a handful of NLP problems that experts consider 'mostly solved' (although you may argue that this doesnâ€™t match your email experience).",ai
Machine translation:,ai
" Google Translate is an example of widely available NLP technology at work. Truly useful machine translation involves more than replacing words in one language with words of another.  Effective translation has to capture accurately the meaning and tone of the input language and translate it to text with the same meaning and desired impact in the output language. Machine translation tools are making good progress in terms of accuracy. A great way to test any machine translation tool is to translate text to one language and then back to the original. An oft-cited classic example: Not long ago, translating â€œThe spirit is willing but the flesh is weakâ€‌ from English to Russian and back yielded â€œThe vodka is good but the meat is rotten.â€‌ Today, the result is â€œThe spirit desires, but the flesh is weak,â€‌ which isnâ€™t perfect, but inspires much more confidence in the English-to-Russian translation.",ai
agents and chatbots,ai
Virtual agents such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa use speech recognition to recognize patterns in voice commands and natural language generation to respond with appropriate action or helpful comments. ,ai
"Chatbots perform the same magic in response to typed text entries. The best of these also learn to recognize contextual clues about human requests and use them to provide even better responses or options over time. The next enhancement for these applications is question answering, the ability to respond to our questionsâ€”anticipated or notâ€”with relevant and helpful answers in their own words.",ai
Social media sentiment analysis,ai
"NLP has become an essential business tool for uncovering hidden data insights from social media channels. Sentiment analysis can analyze language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and eventsâ€“information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more.",ai
Text summarization,ai
" Text summarization uses NLP techniques to digest huge volumes of digital text and create summaries and synopses for indexes, research databases, or busy readers who don't have time to read full text. The best text summarization applications use semantic reasoning and natural language generation (NLG) to add useful context and conclusions to summaries.",ai
Natural language processing and IBM Watson,ai
IBM has innovated in the artificial intelligence space by pioneering NLP-driven tools and services that enable organizations to automate their complex business processes while gaining essential business insights. ,ai

"The most visible advances have been in what’s called “natural language processing” (NLP), the branch of AI focused on how computers can process language like humans do. It has been used to write an article for The Guardian, and AI-authored blog posts have gone viral — feats that weren’t possible a few years ago. AI even excels at cognitive tasks like programming where it is able to generate programs for simple video games from human instructions.",ai
"When a computer software succeedsâ€”when it meets the needs of the people who use it, when it performs flawlessly over a long period of time, when it is easy to modify and even easier to useâ€”it can and does change things for the better",SE
" But when software failsâ€”when its users are dissatisfied, when it is error prone, when it is difficult to change and even harder to useâ€”bad things can and do happen",SE
" We all want to build software that makes things better, avoiding the bad things that lurk in the shadow of failed efforts",SE
" To succeed, we need discipline when software is designed and built",SE
 We need an engineering approach,SE
" In the 20 years since the first edition of this book was written, software engineering has evolved from an obscure idea practiced by a relatively small number of zealots to a legitimate engineering discipline",SE
" Today, it is recognized as a subject worthy of serious research, conscientious study, and tumultuous debate",SE
" Throughout the industry, software engineer has replaced programmer as the job title of preference",SE
" Software process models, software engineering methods, and software tools have been adopted successfully across a broad spectrum of industry applications",SE
" Although managers and practitioners alike recognize the need for a more disciplined approach to software, they continue to debate the manner in which discipline is to be applied",SE
" Many individuals and companies still develop software haphazardly, even as they build systems to service the most advanced technologies of the day",SE
 Many professionals and students are unaware of modern methods,SE
" And as a result, the quality of the software that we produce suffers and bad things happen",SE
" In addition, debate and controversy about the true nature of the software engineering approach continue",SE
 The status of software engineering is a study in contrasts,SE
" Attitudes have changed, progress has been made, but much remains to be done before the discipline reaches full maturity",SE
 The fifth edition of Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach is intended to serve as a guide to a maturing engineering discipline,SE
" The fifth edition, like the four editions that preceded it, is intended for both students and practitioners, retaining its appeal as a guide to the industry professional and a comprehensive introduction to the student at the upper level undergraduate or first year graduate level",SE
" The format and style of the fifth edition have undergone significant change, making the presentation more reader-friendly and the content more easily accessible",SE
 The fifth edition is considerably more than a simple update,SE
 The book has been revised to accommodate the dramatic growth in the field and to emphasize new and important software engineering practices,SE
" In addition, a comprehensive Web site has been developed to complement the content of the book",SE
" The Web site, which I call SepaWeb, can be found at http://www",SE
com/pressman,SE
" Designed to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition of Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, SepaWeb provides a broad array of software engineering resources that will benefit instructors, students, and industry professionals",SE
" Like all Web sites, SepaWeb will evolve over time, but the following major content areas will always be present: (1) a broad array of instructor resources including a comprehensive on-line Instructorâ€™s Guide and supplementary teaching materials (e",SE
", slide presentations to supplement lectures, video-based instructional aids); (2) a wide variety of student resources including an extensive on-line learning center (encompassing study guides, Web-based resources, and self-tests), an evolving collection of â€œtiny tools,â€‌ a case study, and additional supplementary content; and (3) a detailed collection of professional resources including outlines (and samples of) software engineering documents and other work products, a useful set of software engineering checklists, a catalog of software engineering (CASE) tools, a comprehensive collection of Web-based resources, and an â€œadaptable process modelâ€‌ that provides a detailed task breakdown of the software engineering process",SE
" In addition, SepaWeb will contain other goodies that are currently in development",SE
 The 32 chapters of the fifth edition have been organized into five parts,SE
 This has been done to compartmentalize topics and assist instructors who may not have the time to complete the entire book in one term,SE
" Part One, The Product and the Process, presents an introduction to the software engineering milieu",SE
" It is intended to introduce the subject matter, and more important, to present concepts that will be necessary for later chapters",SE
" Part Two, Managing Software Projects, presents topics that are relevant to those who plan, manage, and control a software development project",SE
" Part Three, Conventional Methods for Software Engineering, presents the classical analysis, design, and testing methods that some view as the â€œconventionalâ€‌ school of software engineering",SE
" Part Four, Object-Oriented Software Engineering, presents object-oriented methods across the entire software engineering process, including analysis, design, and testing",SE
" Part Five, Advanced Software Engineering Topics, presents dedicated chapters that address formal methods, cleanroom software engineering, component-based software engineering, client/server software engineering, Web engineering, reengineering, and CASE",SE
" The five-part organization of the fifth edition enables an instructor to ""cluster"" topics based on available time and student need",SE
 An entire one-term course can be built around one or more of the five parts,SE
" For example, a ""design course"" might emphasize only Part Three or Part Four; a ""methods course"" might present selected chapters in Parts Three, Four, and Five",SE
" A ""management course"" would stress Parts One and Two",SE
" By organizing the fifth edition in this way, I attempted to provide an instructor with a number of teaching options",SE
 SepaWeb can and should be used to supplement the content that is chosen from the book,SE
 An Instructor's Guide for Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach is available from SepaWeb,SE
" Software engineering education aims to bring together theory and practice, so that the learner may develop a deep understanding on cornerstone concepts and principles, along with skills and competences to solve real-world problems",SE
" Thus, it is not merely an academic concern about teaching relevant topics, but also a responsibility to shape skilled individuals adequate for the industry demand",SE
" Moreover, due to the fact that the software industry is developing rapidly and becoming transnational [1], several challenges are facing the qualification of software engineers, capable to develop products according to the international industrial standards into overseas markets",SE
" Despite the celebration of its 50th anniversary in 2018, software engineering is a young and promising discipline which is still under development and improvement, which is also the case for software engineering education",SE
" In the last years, several pedagogical approaches had been implemented aiming at improving learnersâ€™ motivation and engagement [2]",SE
" The increasingly adoption of technology in the classroom disrupted traditional models in terms of lecturer-learner interaction, group dynamics, content delivering, and learning experience, just to mention a few",SE
" The rationale behind these pedagogical approaches lies in the attempt to produce innovative solutions that may enable place-based or remotely personalized and selfpaced learning, in which, the lecturer may arrange appropriate learning activities to promote student thinking and further enhancing their cognitive levels and problem solving abilities",SE
 Software engineering education requires both hard and soft skills,SE
" Technical competencies such as requirements engineering, modelling, programming, and testing are desirable",SE
" The ability to communicate, to cooperate, to connect pieces of knowledge to discover solutions, and to think critically are also strongly recommended",SE
" Since soft skills develop over time and require practice, it is promising that its awareness and learning may be provided in advance throughout a studentsâ€™ coursework and infused into software engineering curriculum",SE
" In the recent years, new approaches such as the formation of interdisciplinary teams composed by software engineering students and entrepreneurship students [3], or the stimulus for prototyping adoption through the end-user experience driven [4, 5], were mentioned in the literature",SE
" The instruction of theoretical concepts, and practical skills in an individual-centered learning environment is an ideal teaching strategy for students [4], which is why several body of knowledge on the software engineering context were proposed",SE
" The most relevant ones are the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) [6], and the ACM/IEEE Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering [7]",SE
" Both guides aim to meet the challenge of rapidly changing landscape of software engineering, and to aggregate the diversity, and complementary of new emerging domains that interconnect with software engineering",SE
" Recent pedagogical trends such as the studentsâ€™ empowerment, engagement, and motivation replaced the old-fashioned models to deliver software engineering lectures",SE
 This paved the way for adoption of technologies in the classroom which may represents a double challenge,SE
" On the one hand, unique and/or complementary technologies must be wisely used to shape an effective and profitable learning tool; capable to enhance studentsâ€™ soft and hard skills, instead an additional source of distraction",SE
" On the other hand, learning contents and other materials may be delivered not only in a digital format, but also through different education scenarios such as traditional place-based, online, or blended (combining placebased and online)",SE
" On top of that, modern students expect a personalized and self-paced learning",SE
 Software engineering education is expected to prepare students ready to step directly into software developer positions and succeed,SE
" In [8], authors highlighted the gap between academia and industry as a motivation for the introduction of an educational program",SE
 The main goal is to provide an immerse learning experience that may guide students for complementary skills achievement required by the curriculum and by industry,SE
" Congruently, [9] also focused in the gap between academia and industry in which the balance between hard and soft skills through realistic projects was recommended on the learning process",SE
" In [10], authors proposed a framework; called Essence, to describe the commonality and the diversity of software engineering practices",SE
 The ultimate goal is to enhance the learning process by means of providing tools that may enable students to learn and to understand the diversity of software engineering later in their career,SE
"The convention in these notes will follow that of OpenGL, placing the origin in the lower left corner, with that pixel being at location (0, 0)",CG
 Be aware that placing the origin in the upper left is another common convention,CG
" One of 2 N intensities or colors are associated with each pixel, where N is the number of bits per pixel",CG
" Greyscale typically has one byte per pixel, for 2 8 = 256 intensities",CG
" Color often requires one byte per channel, with three color channels per pixel: red, green, and blue",CG
 Color data is stored in a frame buffer,CG
 This is sometimes called an image map or bitmap,CG
 Primitive operations: ,CG
" setpixel(x, y, color) Sets the pixel at position (x, y) to the given color",CG
"  getpixel(x, y) Gets the color at the pixel at position (x, y)",CG
" Scan conversion is the process of converting basic, low level objects into their corresponding pixel map representations",CG
" This is often an approximation to the object, since the frame buffer is a discrete grid",CG
" computer graphics, production of images on computers for use in any medium",CG
" Images used in the graphic design of printed material are frequently produced on computers, as are the still and moving images seen in comic strips and animations",CG
 The realistic images viewed and manipulated in electronic games and computer simulations could not be created or supported without the enhanced capabilities of modern computer graphics,CG
" Computer graphics also are essential to scientific visualization, a discipline that uses images and colours to model complex phenomena such as air currents and electric fields, and to computer-aided engineering and design, in which objects are drawn and analyzed in computer programs",CG
" Even the windows-based graphical user interface, now a common means of interacting with innumerable computer programs, is a product of computer graphics",CG
" Images have high information content, both in terms of information theory (i",CG
", the number of bits required to represent images) and in terms of semantics (i",CG
", the meaning that images can convey to the viewer)",CG
" Because of the importance of images in any domain in which complex information is displayed or manipulated, and also because of the high expectations that consumers have of image quality, computer graphics have always placed heavy demands on computer hardware and software",CG
" In the 1960s early computer graphics systems used vector graphics to construct images out of straight line segments, which were combined for display on specialized computer video monitors",CG
" Vector graphics is economical in its use of memory, as an entire line segment is specified simply by the coordinates of its endpoints",CG
" However, it is inappropriate for highly realistic images, since most images have at least some curved edges, and using all straight lines to draw curved objects results in a noticeable â€œstair-stepâ€‌ effect",CG
" In the late 1970s and â€™80s raster graphics, derived from television technology, became more common, though still limited to expensive graphics workstation computers",CG
 Raster graphics represents images by bitmaps stored in computer memory and displayed on a screen composed of tiny pixels,CG
 Each pixel is represented by one or more memory bits,CG
" One bit per pixel suffices for black-and-white images, while four bits per pixel specify a 16-step gray-scale image",CG
 Eight bits per pixel specify an image with 256 colour levels; so-called â€œtrue colorâ€‌ requires 24 bits per pixel (specifying more than 16 million colours),CG
" At that resolution, or bit depth, a full-screen image requires several megabytes (millions of bytes; 8 bits = 1 byte) of memory",CG
" Since the 1990s, raster graphics has become ubiquitous",CG
 Personal computers are now commonly equipped with dedicated video memory for holding high-resolution bitmaps,CG
" Although used for display, bitmaps are not appropriate for most computational tasks, which need a three-dimensional representation of the objects composing the image",CG
" One standard benchmark for the rendering of computer models into graphical images is the Utah Teapot, created at the University of Utah in 1975",CG
" Represented skeletally as a wire-frame image, the Utah Teapot is composed of many small polygons",CG
" However, even with hundreds of polygons, the image is not smooth",CG
" Smoother representations can be provided by Bezier curves, which have the further advantage of requiring less computer memory",CG
" Bezier curves are described by cubic equations; a cubic curve is determined by four points or, equivalently, by two points and the curveâ€™s slopes at those points",CG
 Two cubic curves can be smoothly joined by giving them the same slope at the junction,CG
" Bezier curves, and related curves known as B-splines, were introduced in computer-aided design programs for the modeling of automobile bodies",CG
 Rendering offers a number of other computational challenges in the pursuit of realism,CG
 Objects must be transformed as they rotate or move relative to the observerâ€™s viewpoint,CG
" As the viewpoint changes, solid objects must obscure those behind them, and their front surfaces must obscure their rear ones",CG
" This technique of â€œhidden surface eliminationâ€‌ may be done by extending the pixel attributes to include the â€œdepthâ€‌ of each pixel in a scene, as determined by the object of which it is a part",CG
 Algorithms can then compute which surfaces in a scene are visible and which ones are hidden by others,CG
" In computers equipped with specialized graphics cards for electronic games, computer simulations, and other interactive computer applications, these algorithms are executed so quickly that there is no perceptible lagâ€”that is, rendering is achieved in â€œreal time",CG
 Visual appearance includes more than just shape and colour; texture and surface finish (e,CG
", matte, satin, glossy) also must be accurately modeled",CG
" The effects that these attributes have on an objectâ€™s appearance depend in turn on the illumination, which may be diffuse, from a single source, or both",CG
 There are several approaches to rendering the interaction of light with surfaces,CG
" The simplest shading techniques are flat, Gouraud, and Phong",CG
" In flat shading, no textures are used and only one colour tone is used for the entire object, with different amounts of white or black added to each face of the object to simulate shading",CG
 The resulting model appears flat and unrealistic,CG
" In Gouraud shading, textures may be used (such as wood, stone, stucco, and so forth); each edge of the object is given a colour that factors in lighting, and the computer interpolates (calculates intermediate values) to create a smooth gradient over each face",CG
 This results in a much more realistic image,CG
 Modern computer graphics systems can render Gouraud images in real time,CG
 In Phong shading each pixel takes into account any texture and all light sources,CG
 It generally gives more realistic results but is somewhat slower,CG
The shading techniques described thus far do not model specular reflection from glossy surfaces or model transparent and translucent objects,CG
" This can be done by ray tracing, a rendering technique that uses basic optical laws of reflection and refraction",CG
 Ray tracing follows an imaginary light ray from the viewpoint through each point in a scene,CG
" When the ray encounters an object, it is traced as it is reflected or refracted",CG
 Ray tracing is a recursive procedure; each reflected or refracted ray is again traced in the same fashion until it vanishes into the background or makes an insignificant contribution,CG
 Ray tracing may take a long timeâ€”minutes or even hours can be consumed in creating a complex scene,CG
"In reality, objects are illuminated not only directly by a light source such as the Sun or a lamp but also more diffusely by reflected light from other objects",CG
" This type of lighting is re-created in computer graphics by radiosity techniques, which model light as energy rather than rays and which look at the effects of all the elements in a scene on the appearance of each object",CG
" For example, a brightly coloured object will cast a slight glow of the same colour on surrounding surfaces",CG
" Like ray tracing, radiosity applies basic optical principles to achieve realismâ€”and like ray tracing, it is computationally expensive",CG
" One way to reduce the time required for accurate rendering is to use parallel processing, so that in ray shading, for example, multiple rays can be traced at once",CG
" Another technique, pipelined parallelism, takes advantage of the fact that graphics processing can be broken into stagesâ€”constructing polygons or Bezier surfaces, eliminating hidden surfaces, shading, rasterization, and so on",CG
" Using pipelined parallelism, as one image is being rasterized, another can be shaded, and a third can be constructed",CG
 Both kinds of parallelism are employed in high-performance graphics processors,CG
 Demanding applications with many images may also use â€œfarmsâ€‌ of computers,CG
" Even with all of this power, it may take days to render the many images required for a computer-animated motion picture",CG
Computer graphics relies heavily on standard software packages,CG
 The OpenGL (open graphics library) specifies a standard set of graphics routines that may be implemented in computer programming languages such as C or Java,CG
 PHIGS (programmerâ€™s hierarchical interactive graphics system) is another set of graphics routines,CG
 VRML (virtual reality modeling language) is a graphics description language for World Wide Web applications,CG
 Several commercial and free packages provide extensive three-dimensional modeling capabilities for realistic graphics,CG
" More modest tools, offering only elementary two-dimensional graphics, are the â€œpaintâ€‌ programs commonly installed on home computers",CG
" computer graphics, Use of computers to produce visual images, or the images so produced",CG
" Creating computer graphics requires a digital computer to store and manipulate images, a display screen, input/output devices, and specialized software that enables the computer to draw, colour, and manipulate images held in memory",CG
" Common computer graphic formats include GIF and JPEG, for single images, and MPEG and Quicktime, for multiframe images",CG
" The field has widespread use in business, scientific research, and entertainment",CG
 Monitors attached to CAD/CAM systems have replaced drafting boards,CG
" Computer simulation using graphically displayed quantities permits scientific study and testing of such phenomena as nuclear and chemical reactions, gravitational interactions, and physiological systems",CG
 See also computer animation; computer art,CG
" The term â€œcomputer graphicsâ€‌ refers to anything involved in the creation or manipulation of images on a computer, including animated images",CG
" It is a very broad field, and one in which changes and advances seem to come at a dizzying pace",CG
 It can be difficult for a beginner to know where to start,CG
" However, there is a core of fundamental ideas that are part of the foundation of most applications of computer graphics",CG
" This book attempts to cover those foundational ideas, or at least as many of them as will fit into a one-semester college-level course",CG
 While it is not possible to cover the entire field in a first courseâ€”or even a large part of itâ€”this should be a good place to start,CG
 graphics,CG
" For example, it can be seen in a division between two categories of programs that can be used to create images: painting programs and drawing programs",CG
" In a painting program, the image is represented as a grid of pixels, and the user creates an image by assigning colors to pixels",CG
" This might be done by using a â€œdrawing toolâ€‌ that acts like a painterâ€™s brush, or even by tools that draw geometric shapes such as lines or rectangles",CG
" But the point in a painting program is to color the individual pixels, and it is only the pixel colors that are saved",CG
" To make this clearer, suppose that you use a painting program to draw a house, then draw a tree in front of the house",CG
" If you then erase the tree, youâ€™ll only reveal a blank background, not a house",CG
" In fact, the image never really contained a â€œhouseâ€‌ at allâ€”only individually colored pixels that the viewer might perceive as making up a picture of a house",CG
" In a drawing program, the user creates an image by adding geometric shapes, and the image is represented as a list of those shapes",CG
" If you place a house shape (or collection of shapes making up a house) in the image, and you then place a tree shape on top of the house, the house is still there, since it is stored in the list of shapes that the image contains",CG
" If you delete the tree, the house will still be in the image, just as it was before you added the tree",CG
" Furthermore, you should be able to select one of the shapes in the image and move it or change its size, so drawing programs offer a rich set of editing operations that are not possible in painting programs",CG
" (The reverse, however, is also true",CG
") A practical program for image creation and editing might combine elements of painting and drawing, although one or the other is usually dominant",CG
" For example, a drawing program might allow the user to include a raster-type image, treating it as one shape",CG
" A painting program might let the user create â€œlayers,â€‌ which are separate images that can be layered one on top of another to create the final image",CG
" The layers can then be manipulated much like the shapes in a drawing program (so that you could keep both your house and your tree in separate layers, even if in the image of the house is in back of the tree)",CG
 Two well-known graphics programs are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator,CG
" Photoshop is in the category of painting programs, while Illustrator is more of a drawing program",CG
" In the world of free software, the GNU image-processing program, Gimp, is a good alternative to Photoshop, while Inkscape is a reasonably capable free drawing program",CG
 Short introductions to Gimp and Inkscape can be found in Appendix C,CG
" When we turn to 3D graphics, we find that the most common approaches have more in common with vector graphics than with raster graphics",CG
" That is, the content of an image is specified as a list of geometric objects",CG
 The technique is referred to as geometric modeling,CG
" The starting point is to construct an â€œartificial 3D worldâ€‌ as a collection of simple geometric shapes, arranged in three-dimensional space",CG
" The objects can have attributes that, combined with global properties of the world, determine the appearance of the objects",CG
" Often, the range of basic shapes is very limited, perhaps including only points, line segments, and triangles",CG
" We want to build a scene inside the world, made up of geometric objects",CG
" For example, we can specify a line segment in the scene by giving the coordinates of its two endpoints, and we can specify a triangle by giving the coordinates of its three vertices",CG
" The smallest building blocks that we have to work with, such as line segments and triangles, are called geometric primitives",CG
" Different graphics systems make different sets of primitive available, but in many cases only very basic shapes such as lines and triangles are considered primitive",CG
" A complex scene can contain a large number of primitives, and it would be very difficult to create the scene by giving explicit coordinates for each individual primitive",CG
" The solution, as any programmer should immediately guess, is to chunk together primitives into reusable components",CG
" For example, for a scene that contains several automobiles, we might create a geometric model of a wheel",CG
 An automobile can be modeled as four wheels together with models of other components,CG
 And we could then use several copies of the automobile model in the scene,CG
" Note that once a geometric model has been designed, it can be used as a component in more complex models",CG
 This is referred to as hierarchical modeling,CG
 Suppose that we have constructed a model of a wheel out of geometric primitives,CG
" When that wheel is moved into position in the model of an automobile, the coordinates of all of its primitives will have to be adjusted",CG
 So what exactly have we gained by building the wheel? The point is that all of the coordinates in the wheel are adjusted in the same way,CG
" That is, to place the wheel in the automobile, we just have to specify a single adjustment that is applied to the wheel as a whole",CG
 The type of â€œadjustmentâ€‌ that is used is called a geometric transform (or geometric transformation),CG
" A geometric transform is used to adjust the size, orientation, and position of a geometric object",CG
" When making a model of an automobile, we build one wheel",CG
 We then apply four different transforms to the wheel model to add four copies of the wheel to the automobile,CG
" Similarly, we can add several automobiles to a scene by applying different transforms to the same automobile model",CG
" The three most basic kinds of geometric transform are called scaling, rotation, and translation",CG
" A scaling transform is used to set the size of an object, that is, to make it bigger or smaller by some specified factor",CG
" A rotation transform is used to set an objectâ€™s orientation, by rotating it by some angle about some specific axis",CG
" A translation transform is used to set the position of an object, by displacing it by a given amount from its original position",CG
" In this book, we will meet these transformations first in two dimensions, where they are easier to understand",CG
 But it is in 3D graphics that they become truly essential,CG
"Many types of graphics, image graphics, video graphics, motion graphics appear on the screen of your computer or mobile, which attracts people a lot",CG
"Computer graphics It is often abbreviated as CG, is an art of drawing pictures, lines, shape, charts, etc",CG
 Using computers with the help of mathematical algorithms programmed,CG
" It is the science that merge between theory and technology to produce an image with lines, or an number of composed shapes",CG
 Computer graphics image is made up of number of pixels,CG
 Pixel is an abbreviation of (picture element) it is the smallest addressable graphical unit represented on the computer screen ,CG
 CG developed since the last 20 years,CG
 Computer is information processing machine and communication,CG
 The computer graphics is one of the most effective and commonly used ways of communication with the user,CG
" It displays the information in the form of graphical objects such as pictures, charts, diagram and graphs",CG
 In computer graphics picture or graphics objects are presented as a collection of discrete pixels,CG
 The user can control intensity and color of pixel which decide how picture look like,CG
 The process of representing continuous picture or graphics object as a collection of discrete pixelsis called ScanConversion,CG
 Photo: It is any image captured by digital camera or by mobile or with the classical camera,CG
 Picture: is the old name of image,CG
 Image: addressed all type of image (still or video),CG
 Pixel: pixel can be specified by its row and column numbers,CG
 It can be simply black and white system (monochrome) or color system,CG
" In B/W system each pixel is either ON or OFF, so only one bit per pixel is needed",CG
 It provides tools for producing picture of â€œreal-worldâ€‌ as well as synthetic objects such as mathematical surfaces in 4D and 3D of data that have no inherent geometry such as survey result,CG
 It is capability to show moving pictures and video thus possible to produce animations with computer graphics,CG
" As well as controls the animation by adjusting the speed, portion of picture in view the amount of detail shown and so on",CG
CG provides tools called motion dynamics,CG
 In which user can move objects as well as observes as per requirement for example walk throw made by builderto show flat interior and surrounding,CG
It provides facility called update dynamics,CG
 With this we can change the shape color and other properties of object,CG
recently the development of digital signal processing and audio synthesis chip provide the interface between the sound with graphics,CG

The programs are called shaders (although the term doesâ€™t really describe what most of them actually do),CG
 The first shaders to be introduced were vertex shaders and fragment shaders,CG
" When a primitive is drawn, some work has to be done at each vertex of the primitive, such as applying a geometric transform to the vertex coodinates or using the attributes and global lighting environment to compute the color of that vertex",CG
 A vertex shader is a program that can take over the job of doing such â€œper-vertexâ€‌ computations,CG
" Similarly, some work has to be done for each pixel inside the primitive",CG
 A fragment shader can take over the job of performing such â€œper-pixelâ€‌ computations,CG
 (Fragment shaders are also called pixel shaders,CG
) The idea of programmable graphics hardware was very successfulâ€”so successful that in OpenGL 3,CG
"0, the usual per-vertex and per-fragment processing was deprecated (meaning that its use was discouraged)",CG
 And in OpenGL 3,CG
" In practice, all the original features of OpenGL are still supported in desktop versions of OpenGL and will probably continue to be available in the future",CG
" On the embedded system side, however, with OpenGL ES 2",CG
"0 and later, the use of shaders is mandatory, and a large part of the OpenGL 1",CG
1 API has been completely removed,CG
" WebGL, the version of OpenGL for use in web browsers, is based on OpenGL ES, and it also requires shaders to get anything at all done",CG
" Nevertheless, we will begin our study of OpenGL with version 1",CG
" Most of the concepts and many of the details from that version are still relevant, and it offers an easier entry point for someone new to 3D graphics programming",CG
 OpenGL shaders are written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language),CG
" Like OpenGL itself, GLSL has gone through several versions",CG
" We will spend some time later in the course studying GLSL ES, the version used with WebGL and OpenGL ES",CG
 GLSL uses a syntax similar to the C programming language,CG
" To create a two-dimensional image, each point in the image is assigned a color",CG
 A point in 2D can be identified by a pair of numerical coordinates,CG
 Colors can also be specified numerically,CG
" However, the assignment of numbers to points or colors is somewhat arbitrary",CG
" So we need to spend some time studying coordinate systems, which associate numbers to points, and color models, which associate numbers to colors",CG
 A digital image is made up of rows and columns of pixels,CG
 A pixel in such an image can be specified by saying which column and which row contains it,CG
" In terms of coordinates, a pixel can be identified by a pair of integers giving the column number and the row number",CG
" For example, the pixel with coordinates (3,5) would lie in column number 3 and row number 5",CG
" Conventionally, columns are numbered from left to right, starting with zero",CG
" Most graphics systems, including the ones we will study in this chapter, number rows from top to bottom, starting from zero",CG
" Some, including OpenGL, number the rows from bottom to top instead",CG
 We will be using OpenGL as the primary basis for 3D graphics programming,CG
" The original version of OpenGL was released in 1992 by a company named Silicon Graphics, which was known for its graphics workstationsâ€”powerful, expensive computers designed for intensive graphical applications",CG
" (Today, you probably have more graphics computing power on your smart phone",CG
") OpenGL is supported by the graphics hardware in most modern computing devices, including desktop computers, laptops, and many mobile devices",CG
 This section will give you a bit of background about the history of OpenGL and about the graphics hardware that supports it,CG
" In the first desktop computers, the contents of the screen were managed directly by the CPU",CG
" For example, to draw a line segment on the screen, the CPU would run a loop to set the color of each pixel that lies along the line",CG
" Needless to say, graphics could take up a lot of the CPUâ€™s time",CG
" And graphics performance was very slow, compared to what we expect today",CG
" So what has changed? Computers are much faster in general, of course, but the big change is that in modern computers, graphics processing is done by a specialized component called a GPU , or Graphics Processing Unit",CG
" A GPU includes processors for doing graphics computations; in fact, it can include a large number of such processors that work in parallel to greatly speed up graphical operations",CG
 It also includes its own dedicated memory for storing things like images and lists of coordinates,CG
 GPU processors have very fast access to data that is stored in GPU memoryâ€”much faster than their access to data stored in the computerâ€™s main memory,CG
" To draw a line or perform some other graphical operation, the CPU simply has to send commands, along with any necessary data, to the GPU, which is responsible for actually carrying out those commands",CG
" The CPU offloads most of the graphical work to the GPU, which is optimized to carry out that work very quickly",CG
 The set of commands that the GPU understands make up the API of the GPU,CG
" OpenGL is an example of a graphics API, and most GPUs support OpenGL in the sense that they can understand OpenGL commands, or at least that OpenGL commands can efficiently be translated into commands that the GPU can understand",CG
 OpenGL is not the only graphics API,CG
 The best-known alternatives are probably the proprietary APIs used by Apple and Microsoft,CG
" Appleâ€™s MacOS uses an API known as Metal, while Microsoft Windows uses Direct3D",CG
" Nevertheless, OpenGL can currently still be used on MacOS and Windows",CG
" Furthermore, a newer open API named Vulkan has been defined as a replacement for OpenGL itself",CG
" Vulkan is a complex, low-level API designed more for speed and efficiency rather than ease-of-use, and it will likely not completely replace OpenGL for some time, if ever",CG
" Metal, Direct3D, and Vulkan are not covered in this textbook",CG
 We are using OpenGL since it provides an easier introduction to 3D graphics and because it is still the basis for 3D graphics in Web browsers,CG
" It is impossible for a graphics API to include every possible shape as a basic shape, but there is usually some way to create more complex shapes",CG
" For example, consider polygons",CG
 A polygon is a closed shape consisting of a sequence of line segments,CG
" Each line segment is joined to the next at its endpoint, and the last line segment connects back to the first",CG
" The endpoints are called the vertices of the polygon, and a polygon can be defined by listing its vertices",CG
" In a regular polygon, all the sides are the same length and all the angles between sides are equal",CG
 Squares and equilateral triangles are examples of regular polygons,CG
" A convex polygon has the property that whenever two points are inside or on the polygon, then the entire line segment between those points is also inside or on the polygon",CG
" Intuitively, a convex polygon has no â€œindentationsâ€‌ along its boundary",CG
" (Concavity can be a property of any shape, not just of polygons",CG
") Sometimes, polygons are required to be â€œsimple,â€‌ meaning that the polygon has no selfintersections",CG
" That is, all the vertices are different, and a side can only intersect another side at its endpoints",CG
" And polygons are usually required to be â€œplanar,â€‌ meaning that all the vertices lie in the same plane",CG
" (Of course, in 2D graphics, everything lies in the same plane, so this is not an issue",CG
" However, it does become an issue in 3D",CG
") How then should we draw polygons? That is, what capabilities would we like to have in a graphics API for drawing them",CG
" One possibility is to have commands for stroking and for filling polygons, where the vertices of the polygon are given as an array of points or as an array of x-coordinates plus an array of y-coordinates",CG
" In fact, that is sometimes done; for example, the Java graphics API includes such commands",CG
" Another, more flexible, approach is to introduce the idea of a â€œpath",CG
"â€‌ Java, SVG, and the HTML canvas API all support this idea",CG
 A path is a general shape that can include both line segments and curved segments,CG
 ne down the middle of the road,CG
) Each arrow in the picture can be associated with a modeling transformation that places the sub-object into its parent object,CG
" When an object contains several copies of a sub-object, each arrow connecting the sub-object to the object will have a different associated modeling transformation",CG
 The object is the same for each copy; only the transformation differs,CG
" Although the scene graph exists conceptually, in some applications it exists only implicitly",CG
" For example, the Java version of the program that was mentioned above draws the image â€œprocedurally,â€‌ that is, by calling subroutines",CG
 There is no data structure to represent the scene graph,CG
" Instead, the scene graph is implicit in the sequence of subroutine calls that draw the scene",CG
" Each node in the graph is a subroutine, and each arrow is a subroutine call",CG
 The various objects are drawn using different modeling transformations,CG
"8, the computer only keeps track of a â€œcurrent transformationâ€‌ that represents all the transforms that are applied to an object",CG
" When an object is drawn by a subroutine, the program saves the current transformation before calling the subroutine",CG
" After the subroutine returns, the saved transformation is restored",CG
" Inside the subroutine, the object is drawn in its own coordinate system, possibly calling other subroutines to draw sub-objects with their own modeling transformations",CG
" Those extra transformations will have no effect outside of the subroutine, since the transform that is in effect before the subroutine is called will be restored after the subroutine returns",CG
 It is also possible for a scene graph to be represented by an actual data structure in the program,CG
" In an object-oriented approach, the graphical objects in the scene are represented by program objects",CG
 There are many ways to build an object-oriented scene graph API,CG
" For a simple example implemented in Java, you can take a look at java2d/SceneGraphAPI2D",CG
java,CG
" This program draws the same animated scene as the previous example, but it represents the scene with an object-oriented data structure rather than procedurally",CG
 The same scene graph API is implemented in JavaScript in the live demo c2/cart-and-windmills,CG
"html, and you might take a look at its source code after you read about HTML canvas graphics in Section 2",CG
" In the example program, both in Java and in JavaScript, a node in the scene graph is represented by an object belonging to a class named SceneGraphNode",CG
" SceneGraphNode is an abstract class, and actual nodes in the scene graph are defined by subclasses of that class",CG
" For example, there is a subclass named CompoundObject to represent a complex graphical object that is made up of sub-objects",CG
" A variable, obj, of type CompoundObject includes a method obj",CG
add(subobj) for adding a sub-object to the compound object,CG
" When implementing a scene graph as a data structure made up of objects, a decision has to be made about how to handle transforms",CG
 One option is to allow transformations to be associated with any node in the scene graph,CG
" In this case, however, I decided to use special nodes to represent transforms as objects of type TransformedObject",CG
 A TransformedObject is a SceneGraphNode that contains a link to another SceneGraphNode and also contains a modeling transformation that is to be applied to that object,CG
" The modeling transformation is given in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation amounts that are instance variables in the object",CG
" It is worth noting that these are always applied in the order scale, then rotate, then translate, no matter what order the instance variables are set in the code",CG
" If you want to do a translation followed by a rotation, you will need two TransformedObjects to implement it, since a translation plus a rotation in the same TransformedObject would be applied in the order rotate-then-translate",CG
" It is also worth noting that the setter methods for the scaling, rotation",CG
 The animation shows a growing â€œtreeâ€‌ made from a green triangle and a brown rectangle,CG
" In the animation, the transform goes from scale(0,0) to scale(0",CG
 The animation starts 3 seconds after the image loads and lasts 15 seconds,CG
" At the end of the animation, the tree freezes at its final scale",CG
 The transform attribute on the element specifies the scale that is in effect until the animation starts,CG
" (A scale factor of 0 collapses the object to size zero, so that it is invisible",CG
") You can find this example, along with a moving rectangle and a keyframe animation, in the sample file svg/first-svg-animation",CG
" You can create animated objects in the section of an SVG file, and you can apply animation to elements",CG
 This makes it possible to create hierarchical animations,CG
 A simple example can be found in the sample file svg/hierarchical-animation,CG
 The example shows a rotating hexagon with a rotating square at each vertex of the hexagon,CG
" The hexagon is constructed from six copies of one object, with a different rotation applied to each copy",CG
 A copy of the basic object is shown in the image to the right of the hexagon,CG
The square is defined as an animated object with its own rotation,CG
 It is used as a sub-object in the hexagon,CG
" The rotation that is applied to the hexagon applies to the square, on top of its own built-in rotation",CG
 Thatâ€™s what makes this an example of hierarchical animation,CG
" If you look back at the cart-and-windmills example now, you can probably see how to do the animation",CG
" Donâ€™t forget to check out the source code, which is surprisingly short!",CG
"After learning Swift, the next step is to study the vast iOS platform that is comprised of different design patterns, frameworks, and other technologies",CG
" Even if you decide to pursue a programming language other than Swift to develop iOS apps, you will still need to understand how things work in the iOS ecosystem",CG
"As with anything you want to master, starting by learning the fundamentals is the best way to go",CG
" Without learning the fundamentals, you wonâ€™t be able to use the more exciting technologies like augmented reality, artificial intelligence, or even building games",CG
" More importantly, without learning the fundamentals, you wonâ€™t have the essential knowledge required to gain employment or build apps that people will want to use",CG
including its graphics processors and memory,CG
 The server executes OpenGL commands,CG
" The client is the CPU in the same computer, along with the application program that it is running",CG
 OpenGL commands come from the program that is running on the CPU,CG
" However, it is actually possible to run OpenGL programs remotely over a network",CG
" That is, you can execute an application program on a remote computer (the OpenGL client), while the graphics computations and display are done on the computer that you are actually using (the OpenGL server)",CG
" The key idea is that the client and the server are separate components, and there is a communication channel between those components",CG
 OpenGL commands and the data that they need are communicated from the client (the CPU) to the server (the GPU) over that channel,CG
 The capacity of the channel can be a limiting factor in graphics performance,CG
 Think of drawing an image onto the screen,CG
" If the GPU can draw the image in microseconds, but it takes milliseconds to send the data for the image from the CPU to the GPU, then the great speed of the GPU is irrelevantâ€”most of the time that it takes to draw the image is communication time",CG
" For this reason, one of the driving factors in the evolution of OpenGL has been the desire to limit the amount of communication that is needed between the CPU and the GPU",CG
 One approach is to store information in the GPUâ€™s memory,CG
" If some data is going to be used several times, it can be transmitted to the GPU once and stored in memory there, where it will be immediately accessible to the GPU",CG
 Another approach is to try to decrease the number of OpenGL commands that must be transmitted to the GPU to draw a given image,CG
 OpenGL draws primitives such as triangles,CG
 Specifying a primitive means specifying coordinates and attributes for each of its vertices,CG
 In the original OpenGL 1,CG
"0, a separate command was used to specify the coordinates of each vertex, and a command was needed each time the value of an attribute changed",CG
 To draw a single triangle would require three or more commands,CG
 Drawing a complex object made up of thousands of triangles would take many thousands of commands,CG
 Even in OpenGL 1,CG
"1, it became possible to draw such an object with a single command instead of thousands",CG
" All the data for the object would be loaded into arrays, which could then be sent in a single step to the GPU",CG
" Unfortunately, if the object was going to be drawn more than once, then the data would have to be retransmitted each time the object was drawn",CG
 This was fixed in OpenGL 1,CG
5 with Vertex Buffer Objects,CG
 A VBO is a block of memory in the GPU that can store the coordinates or attribute values for a set of vertices,CG
 This makes it possible to reuse the data without having to retransmit it from the CPU to the GPU every time it is used,CG
" Similarly, OpenGL 1",CG
1 introduced texture objects to make it possible to store several images on the GPU for use as textures,CG
" This means that texture images that are going to be reused several times can be loaded once into the GPU, so that the GPU can easily switch between images without having to reload them",CG
" âˆ— âˆ— âˆ— As new capabilities were added to OpenGL, the API grew in size",CG
" But the growth was still outpaced by the invention of new, more sophisticated techniques for doing graphics",CG
" Some of these new techniques were added to OpenGL, but the problem is that no matter how many features you add, there will always be demands for new featuresâ€”as well as complaints that all the new features are making things too complicated! OpenGL was a giant machine, with new pieces always being tacked onto it, but still not pleasing everyone",CG
 The real solution was to make the machine programmable,CG
 With OpenGL 2,CG
"0, it became possible to write programs to be executed as part of the graphical computation in the GPU",CG
 The only thing that the API has to support is the ability to send programs to the GPU for execution,CG
 The programs are called shaders (although the term doesâ€™t really describe what most of them actually do),CG
 The first shaders to be introduced were vertex shaders and fragment shaders,CG
" When a primitive is drawn, some work has to be done at each vertex of the primitive, such as applying a geometric transform to the vertex coodinates or using the attributes and global lighting environment to compute the color of that vertex",CG
 A vertex shader is a program that can take over the job of doing such â€œper-vertexâ€‌ computations,CG
" Similarly, some work has to be done for each pixel inside the primitive",CG
 A fragment shader can take over the job of performing such â€œper-pixelâ€‌ computations,CG
 (Fragment shaders are also called pixel shaders,CG
) The idea of programmable graphics hardware was very successfulâ€”so successful that in OpenGL 3,CG
"0, the usual per-vertex and per-fragment processing was deprecated (meaning that its use was discouraged)",CG
 And in OpenGL 3,CG
"1, it was removed from the OpenGL standard, although it is still present as an optional extension",CG
" In practice, all the original features of OpenGL are still supported in desktop versions of OpenGL and will probably continue to be available in the future",CG

"0 and later, the use of shaders is mandatory, and a large part of the OpenGL 1",CG

" We will spend some time later in the course studying GLSL ES, the version used with WebGL and OpenGL ES",CG
 GLSL uses a syntax similar to the C programming language,CG
" As a final remark on GPU hardware, I should note that the computations that are done for different vertices are pretty much independent, and so can potentially be done in parallel",CG
 The same is true of the computations for different fragments,CG
" In fact, GPUs can have hundreds or thousands of processors that can operate in parallel",CG
" Admittedly, the individual processors are much less powerful than a CPU, but then typical per-vertex and per-fragment computations are not very complicated",CG
" The large number of processors, and the large amount of parallelism that is possible in graphics computations, makes for impressive graphics performance even on fairly inexpensive GPUs",CG
" a lot easier to visualize, in 2D than in 3D, but most of the ideas that are covered in this chapter will also be very relevant to 3D",CG
" The chapter begins with four sections that examine 2D graphics in a general way, without tying it to a particular programming language or graphics API",CG
 The coding examples in these sections are written in pseudocode that should make sense to anyone with enough programming background to be reading this book,CG
" In the next three sections, we will take quick looks at 2D graphics in three particular languages: Java with Graphics2D, JavaScript with HTML graphics, and SVG",CG
" We will see how these languages use many of the general ideas from earlier Row and column numbers identify a pixel, not a point",CG
" A pixel contains many points; mathematically, it contains an infinite number of points",CG
 The goal of computer graphics is not really to color pixelsâ€”it is to create and manipulate images,CG
" In some ideal sense, an image should be defined by specifying a color for each point, not just for each pixel",CG
 Pixels are an approximation,CG
" If we imagine that there is a true, ideal image that we want to display, then any image that we display by coloring pixels is an approximation",CG
 This has many implications,CG
" Suppose, for example, that we want to draw a line segment",CG
 A mathematical line has no thickness and would be invisible,CG
" So we really want to draw a thick line segment, with some specified width",CG
 Letâ€™s say that the line should be one pixel wide,CG
" The problem is that, unless the line is horizontal or vertical, we canâ€™t actually draw the line by coloring pixels",CG
 A diagonal geometric line will cover some pixels only partially,CG
 It is not possible to make part of a pixel black and part of it white,CG
" When you try to draw a line with black and white pixels only, the result is a jagged staircase effect",CG
 This effect is an example of something called â€œaliasing,CG
â€‌ Aliasing can also be seen in the outlines of characters drawn on the screen and in diagonal or curved boundaries between any two regions of different color,CG
 (The term aliasing likely comes from the fact that ideal images are naturally described in real-number coordinates,CG
" When you try to represent the image using pixels, many real-number coordinates will map to the same integer pixel coordinates; they can all be considered as different names or â€œaliasesâ€‌ for the same pixel",CG
) Antialiasing is a term for techniques that are designed to mitigate the effects of aliasing,CG
" The idea is that when a pixel is only partially covered by a shape, the color of the pixel should be a mixture of the color of the shape and the color of the background",CG
" When drawing a black line on a white background, the color of a partially covered pixel would be gray, with the shade of gray depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the line",CG
" (In practice, calculating this area exactly for each pixel would be too difficult, so some approximate method is used",CG
") Here, for example, is a geometric line, shown on the left, along with two approximations of that line made by coloring pixels",CG
 The lines are greatly magnified so that you can see the individual pixelscolor) on top of another color (the background color),CG
" If the foreground color is fully opaque, it simply replaces the background color",CG
" If the foreground color is partly transparent, then it is blended with the background color",CG
" Assuming that the alpha component ranges from 0 to 1, the color that you get can be computed as new color = (alpha)*(foreground color) + (1 - alpha)*(background color) This computation is done separately for the red, blue, and green color components",CG
 This is called alpha blending,CG
 The effect is like viewing the background through colored glass; the color of the glass adds a tint to the background color,CG
" This type of blending is not the only possible use of the alpha component, but it is the most common",CG
 An RGBA color model with 8 bits per component uses a total of 32 bits to represent a color,CG
 This is a convenient number because integer values are often represented using 32-bit values,CG
 A 32-bit integer value can be interpreted as a 32-bit RGBA color,CG
 How the color components are arranged within a 32-bit integer is somewhat arbitrary,CG
 This is sometimes called an image map or bitmap,CG
 Primitive operations: ,CG
" setpixel(x, y, color) Sets the pixel at position (x, y) to the given color",CG
"  getpixel(x, y) Gets the color at the pixel at position (x, y)",CG
" Scan conversion is the process of converting basic, low level objects into their corresponding pixel map representations",CG
" This is often an approximation to the object, since the frame buffer is a discrete grid",CG
" computer graphics, production of images on computers for use in any medium",CG
" Images used in the graphic design of printed material are frequently produced on computers, as are the still and moving images seen in comic strips and animations",CG
 The realistic images viewed and manipulated in electronic games and computer simulations could not be created or supported without the enhanced capabilities of modern computer graphics,CG
" Computer graphics also are essential to scientific visualization, a discipline that uses images and colours to model complex phenomena such as air currents and electric fields, and to computer-aided engineering and design, in which objects are drawn and analyzed in computer programs",CG
" Even the windows-based graphical user interface, now a common means of interacting with innumerable computer programs, is a product of computer graphics",CG
" Images have high information content, both in terms of information theory (i",CG
", the number of bits required to represent images) and in terms of semantics (i",CG
", the meaning that images can convey to the viewer)",CG
" Because of the importance of images in any domain in which complex information is displayed or manipulated, and also because of the high expectations that consumers have of image quality, computer graphics have always placed heavy demands on computer hardware and software",CG
" In the 1960s early computer graphics systems used vector graphics to construct images out of straight line segments, which were combined for display on specialized computer video monitors",CG
" Vector graphics is economical in its use of memory, as an entire line segment is specified simply by the coordinates of its endpoints",CG
" However, it is inappropriate for highly realistic images, since most images have at least some curved edges, and using all straight lines to draw curved objects results in a noticeable â€œstair-stepâ€‌ effect",CG
" In the late 1970s and â€™80s raster graphics, derived from television technology, became more common, though still limited to expensive graphics workstation computers",CG
 Raster graphics represents images by bitmaps stored in computer memory and displayed on a screen composed of tiny pixels,CG
 Each pixel is represented by one or more memory bits,CG
" One bit per pixel suffices for black-and-white images, while four bits per pixel specify a 16-step gray-scale image",CG
 Eight bits per pixel specify an image with 256 colour levels; so-called â€œtrue colorâ€‌ requires 24 bits per pixel (specifying more than 16 million colours),CG
" At that resolution, or bit depth, a full-screen image requires several megabytes (millions of bytes; 8 bits = 1 byte) of memory",CG
" Since the 1990s, raster graphics has become ubiquitous",CG
 Personal computers are now commonly equipped with dedicated video memory for holding high-resolution bitmaps,CG
" Although used for display, bitmaps are not appropriate for most computational tasks, which need a three-dimensional representation of the objects composing the image",CG
" One standard benchmark for the rendering of computer models into graphical images is the Utah Teapot, created at the University of Utah in 1975",CG
" Represented skeletally as a wire-frame image, the Utah Teapot is composed of many small polygons",CG
" However, even with hundreds of polygons, the image is not smooth",CG
" Smoother representations can be provided by Bezier curves, which have the further advantage of requiring less computer memory",CG
" Bezier curves are described by cubic equations; a cubic curve is determined by four points or, equivalently, by two points and the curveâ€™s slopes at those points",CG
 Two cubic curves can be smoothly joined by giving them the same slope at the junction,CG
" Bezier curves, and related curves known as B-splines, were introduced in computer-aided design programs for the modeling of automobile bodies",CG
 Rendering offers a number of other computational challenges in the pursuit of realism,CG
 Objects must be transformed as they rotate or move relative to the observerâ€™s viewpoint,CG
" As the viewpoint changes, solid objects must obscure those behind them, and their front surfaces must obscure their rear ones",CG
" This technique of â€œhidden surface eliminationâ€‌ may be done by extending the pixel attributes to include the â€œdepthâ€‌ of each pixel in a scene, as determined by the object of which it is a part",CG
 Algorithms can then compute which surfaces in a scene are visible and which ones are hidden by others,CG
" In computers equipped with specialized graphics cards for electronic games, computer simulations, and other interactive computer applications, these algorithms are executed so quickly that there is no perceptible lagâ€”that is, rendering is achieved in â€œreal time",CG
 Visual appearance includes more than just shape and colour; texture and surface finish (e,CG
", matte, satin, glossy) also must be accurately modeled",CG
" The effects that these attributes have on an objectâ€™s appearance depend in turn on the illumination, which may be diffuse, from a single source, or both",CG
 There are several approaches to rendering the interaction of light with surfaces,CG
" The simplest shading techniques are flat, Gouraud, and Phong",CG
" In flat shading, no textures are used and only one colour tone is used for the entire object, with different amounts of white or black added to each face of the object to simulate shading",CG
 The resulting model appears flat and unrealistic,CG
" In Gouraud shading, textures may be used (such as wood, stone, stucco, and so forth); each edge of the object is given a colour that factors in lighting, and the computer interpolates (calculates intermediate values) to create a smooth gradient over each face",CG
 This results in a much more realistic image,CG
 Modern computer graphics systems can render Gouraud images in real time,CG
 In Phong shading each pixel takes into account any texture and all light sources,CG
 It generally gives more realistic results but is somewhat slower,CG
The shading techniques described thus far do not model specular reflection from glossy surfaces or model transparent and translucent objects,CG
" This can be done by ray tracing, a rendering technique that uses basic optical laws of reflection and refraction",CG
 Ray tracing follows an imaginary light ray from the viewpoint through each point in a scene,CG
" When the ray encounters an object, it is traced as it is reflected or refracted",CG
 Ray tracing is a recursive procedure; each reflected or refracted ray is again traced in the same fashion until it vanishes into the background or makes an insignificant contribution,CG
 Ray tracing may take a long timeâ€”minutes or even hours can be consumed in creating a complex scene,CG
"In reality, objects are illuminated not only directly by a light source such as the Sun or a lamp but also more diffusely by reflected light from other objects",CG
" This type of lighting is re-created in computer graphics by radiosity techniques, which model light as energy rather than rays and which look at the effects of all the elements in a scene on the appearance of each object",CG
" For example, a brightly coloured object will cast a slight glow of the same colour on surrounding surfaces",CG
" Like ray tracing, radiosity applies basic optical principles to achieve realismâ€”and like ray tracing, it is computationally expensive",CG
" One way to reduce the time required for accurate rendering is to use parallel processing, so that in ray shading, for example, multiple rays can be traced at once",CG
" Another technique, pipelined parallelism, takes advantage of the fact that graphics processing can be broken into stagesâ€”constructing polygons or Bezier surfaces, eliminating hidden surfaces, shading, rasterization, and so on",CG
" Using pipelined parallelism, as one image is being rasterized, another can be shaded, and a third can be constructed",CG
 Both kinds of parallelism are employed in high-performance graphics processors,CG
 Demanding applications with many images may also use â€œfarmsâ€‌ of computers,CG
" Even with all of this power, it may take days to render the many images required for a computer-animated motion picture",CG
Computer graphics relies heavily on standard software packages,CG
 The OpenGL (open graphics library) specifies a standard set of graphics routines that may be implemented in computer programming languages such as C or Java,CG
 PHIGS (programmerâ€™s hierarchical interactive graphics system) is another set of graphics routines,CG
 VRML (virtual reality modeling language) is a graphics description language for World Wide Web applications,CG
 Several commercial and free packages provide extensive three-dimensional modeling capabilities for realistic graphics,CG
" More modest tools, offering only elementary two-dimensional graphics, are the â€œpaintâ€‌ programs commonly installed on home computers",CG
" computer graphics, Use of computers to produce visual images, or the images so produced",CG
" Creating computer graphics requires a digital computer to store and manipulate images, a display screen, input/output devices, and specialized software that enables the computer to draw, colour, and manipulate images held in memory",CG
" Common computer graphic formats include GIF and JPEG, for single images, and MPEG and Quicktime, for multiframe images",CG
" The field has widespread use in business, scientific research, and entertainment",CG
 Monitors attached to CAD/CAM systems have replaced drafting boards,CG
" Computer simulation using graphically displayed quantities permits scientific study and testing of such phenomena as nuclear and chemical reactions, gravitational interactions, and physiological systems",CG
 See also computer animation; computer art,CG
" The term â€œcomputer graphicsâ€‌ refers to anything involved in the creation or manipulation of images on a computer, including animated images",CG
" It is a very broad field, and one in which changes and advances seem to come at a dizzying pace",CG
 It can be difficult for a beginner to know where to start,CG
" However, there is a core of fundamental ideas that are part of the foundation of most applications of computer graphics",CG
" This book attempts to cover those foundational ideas, or at least as many of them as will fit into a one-semester college-level course",CG
 While it is not possible to cover the entire field in a first courseâ€”or even a large part of itâ€”this should be a good place to start,CG
 graphics,CG
" For example, it can be seen in a division between two categories of programs that can be used to create images: painting programs and drawing programs",CG
" In a painting program, the image is represented as a grid of pixels, and the user creates an image by assigning colors to pixels",CG
" This might be done by using a â€œdrawing toolâ€‌ that acts like a painterâ€™s brush, or even by tools that draw geometric shapes such as lines or rectangles",CG
" But the point in a painting program is to color the individual pixels, and it is only the pixel colors that are saved",CG
" To make this clearer, suppose that you use a painting program to draw a house, then draw a tree in front of the house",CG
" If you then erase the tree, youâ€™ll only reveal a blank background, not a house",CG
" In fact, the image never really contained a â€œhouseâ€‌ at allâ€”only individually colored pixels that the viewer might perceive as making up a picture of a house",CG
" In a drawing program, the user creates an image by adding geometric shapes, and the image is represented as a list of those shapes",CG
" If you place a house shape (or collection of shapes making up a house) in the image, and you then place a tree shape on top of the house, the house is still there, since it is stored in the list of shapes that the image contains",CG
" If you delete the tree, the house will still be in the image, just as it was before you added the tree",CG
" Furthermore, you should be able to select one of the shapes in the image and move it or change its size, so drawing programs offer a rich set of editing operations that are not possible in painting programs",CG
" (The reverse, however, is also true",CG
") A practical program for image creation and editing might combine elements of painting and drawing, although one or the other is usually dominant",CG
" For example, a drawing program might allow the user to include a raster-type image, treating it as one shape",CG
" A painting program might let the user create â€œlayers,â€‌ which are separate images that can be layered one on top of another to create the final image",CG
" The layers can then be manipulated much like the shapes in a drawing program (so that you could keep both your house and your tree in separate layers, even if in the image of the house is in back of the tree)",CG
 Two well-known graphics programs are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator,CG
" Photoshop is in the category of painting programs, while Illustrator is more of a drawing program",CG
" In the world of free software, the GNU image-processing program, Gimp, is a good alternative to Photoshop, while Inkscape is a reasonably capable free drawing program",CG
 Short introductions to Gimp and Inkscape can be found in Appendix C,CG
Human Computer Interface (HCI) was previously known as the man-machine studies or man-machine interaction,CHI

"Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) is research in the design and the use of computer technology, which focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and computers",CHI
 HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways,CHI
"As a field of research, humanâ€“computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study",CHI
 The term was popularized by Stuart K,CHI
" Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P",CHI
" Moran in their 1983 book, The Psychology of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction",CHI
 The first known use was in 1975 by Carlisle,CHI
"[1] The term is intended to convey that, unlike other tools with specific and limited uses, computers have many uses which often involve an open-ended dialogue between the user and the computer",CHI
 The notion of dialogue likens humanâ€“computer interaction to human-to-human interaction: an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field,CHI
" Humans interact with computers in many ways, and the interface between the two is crucial to facilitating this interaction",CHI
" HCI is also sometimes termed humanâ€“machine interaction (HMI), man-machine interaction (MMI) or computer-human interaction (CHI)",CHI
" Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI) of today",CHI
"[4] Voice user interfaces (VUI) are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms",CHI
" The growth in humanâ€“computer interaction field has led to an increase in the quality of interaction, and resulted in many new areas of research beyond",CHI
" Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches focus on the concepts of multimodality[5] over unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces over command/action based ones, and active interfaces over passive interfaces",CHI
"The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines humanâ€“computer interaction as ""a discipline that is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them""",CHI
[4] An important facet of HCI is user satisfaction (or End-User Computing Satisfaction),CHI
" It goes on to say:""Because humanâ€“computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side",CHI
" On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are relevant",CHI
" On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant",CHI
" And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant",CHI
"[4]Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success.Poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example is the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.[6][7][8] Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instruments or throttle quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the standard"" layout",CHI
" Thus, the conceptually good idea had unintended results",CHI
The humanâ€“computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer,CHI
 The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction,CHI
" The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including:Visual Based: The visual-based humanâ€“computer interaction is probably the most widespread humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) research area",CHI
Audio Based: The audio-based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of HCI systems,CHI
 This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals,CHI
Task environment: The conditions and goals set upon the user,CHI
"Machine environment: The computer's environment is connected to, e",CHI
", a laptop in a college student's dorm room",CHI
"Areas of the interface: Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer, not about their interaction",CHI
" Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes of their interaction",CHI
Input flow: The flow of information begins in the task environment when the user has some task requiring using their computer,CHI
Output: The flow of information that originates in the machine environment,CHI
"Feedback: Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back",CHI
"Fit: This matches the computer design, the user, and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task",CHI
"Humanâ€“computer interaction studies the ways in which humans makeâ€”or do not makeâ€”use of computational artifacts, systems, and infrastructures",CHI
 Much of the research in this field seeks to improve the humanâ€“computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces,CHI
"[9] How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and cultural values, and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated",CHI
" Methods for designing new computer interfaces, thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability, findability, the efficiency of use",CHI
"Methods for implementing interfaces, e",CHI
", by means of software libraries",CHI
Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties,CHI
Methods for studying humanâ€“computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly,CHI
Methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer,CHI
"Models and theories of humanâ€“computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces, sucas cognitivist user models, Activity Theory, or ethnomethodological accounts of humanâ€“computer use",CHI
" Perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design, computer use, and HCI research practice",CHI
 Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve might vary,CHI
" When pursuing a cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities",CHI
" When pursuing a post-cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values",CHI
"Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies, experimenting with devices, prototyping software and hardware systems, exploring interaction paradigms, and developing models and theories of interaction",CHI
"Early focus is placed on the user(s) and task(s): How many users are needed to perform the task(s) is established and who the appropriate users should be is determined (someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user)",CHI
" In addition, the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed is defined",CHI
Empirical measurement: the interface is tested with real users who come in contact with the interface daily,CHI
 The results can vary with the performance level of the user and the typical humanâ€“computer interaction may not always be represented,CHI
" Quantitative usability specifics, such as the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s) are determined",CHI
"Iterative design: After determining what users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, the following iterative design steps",CHI
"The iterative design process is repeated until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created",CHI
Various strategies delineating methods for humanâ€“PC interaction design have developed since the conception of the field during the 1980s,CHI
" Most plan philosophies come from a model for how clients, originators, and specialized frameworks interface",CHI
" Early techniques treated clients' psychological procedures as unsurprising and quantifiable and urged plan specialists to look at subjective science to establish zones, (for example, memory and consideration) when structuring UIs",CHI
" Present-day models, in general, center around a steady input and discussion between clients, creators, and specialists and push for specialized frameworks to be folded with the sorts of encounters clients need to have, as opposed to wrapping user experience around a finished framework",CHI
Activity theory: utilized in HCI to characterize and consider the setting where human cooperations with PCs occur,CHI
 Action hypothesis gives a structure for reasoning about activities in these specific circumstances and illuminates the design of interactions from an action-driven perspective,CHI
"User-centered design (UCD): a cutting-edge, broadly-rehearsed plan theory established on the possibility that clients must become the overwhelming focus in the plan of any PC framework",CHI
" Clients, architects, and specialized experts cooperate to determine the requirements and restrictions of the client and make a framework to support these components",CHI
" Frequently, client-focused plans are informed by ethnographic investigations of situations in which clients will associate with the framework",CHI
" This training is like participatory design, which underscores the likelihood for end-clients to contribute effectively through shared plan sessions and workshops",CHI
"Principles of UI design: these standards may be considered during the design of a client interface: resistance, effortlessness, permeability, affordance, consistency, structure, and feedback",CHI
"Value sensitive design (VSD): a technique for building innovation that accounts for the individuals who utilize the design straightforwardly, and just as well for those who the design influences, either directly or indirectly",CHI
" VSD utilizes an iterative plan process that includes three kinds of examinations: theoretical, exact, and specialized",CHI
" Applied examinations target the understanding and articulation of the different parts of the design, and its qualities or any clashes that may emerge for the users of the design",CHI
" Exact examinations are subjective or quantitative plans to explore things used to advise the creators' understanding regarding the clients' qualities, needs, and practices",CHI
 Specialized examinations can include either investigation of how individuals use related advances or the framework plans,CHI
Displays are human-made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and facilitate further processing of that information,CHI
" Before a display is designed, the task that the display is intended to support must be defined (e",CHI
" A user or operator must be able to process whatever information a system generates and displays; therefore, the information must be displayed according to principles to support perception, situation awareness, and understanding",CHI
Christopher Wickens et al,CHI
 defined 13 principles of display design in their book An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering,CHI
[18]These principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design,CHI
" A reduction in errors, a reduction in required training time, an increase in efficiency, and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved by utilizing these principles",CHI
Certain principles may not apply to different displays or situations,CHI
" Some principles may also appear to be conflicting, and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another",CHI
 The principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation,CHI
 Striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design,CHI
 Make displays legible (or audible),CHI
 A display's legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display,CHI
" If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, the operator cannot effectively use them",CHI
 Avoid absolute judgment limits,CHI
 Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable based on a single sensory variable (e,CHI
" color, size, loudness)",CHI
 These sensory variables can contain many possible levels,CHI
 Top-down processing,CHI
 Signals are likely perceived and interpreted by what is expected based on a user's experience,CHI
" If a signal is presented contrary to the user's expectation, more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly",CHI
Redundancy gain,CHI
" If a signal is presented more than once, it is more likely to be understood correctly",CHI
 This can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms (e,CHI
 as redundancy does not imply repetition,CHI
" A traffic light is a good example of redundancy, as color and position are redundant",CHI
 Similarity causes confusion: Use distinguishable elements,CHI
 Signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused,CHI
 The ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar,CHI
" For example, A423B9 is more similar to A423B8 than 92 is to 93",CHI
" Unnecessarily similar features should be removed, and dissimilar features should be highlighted",CHI
Principle of pictorial realism,CHI
 A display should look like the variable that it represents (e,CHI
the high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level),CHI
" If there are multiple elements, they can be configured in a manner that looks like they would in the represented environment",CHI
 Principle of the moving part,CHI
 Moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user's mental model of how it actually moves in the system,CHI
" For example, the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude",CHI
Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world,CHI
 A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long-term memory,CHI
" A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory",CHI
" However, memory use may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some knowledge globally (e",CHI
an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual),CHI
 The use of knowledge in a user's head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design,CHI
Principle of predictive aiding,CHI
 Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions,CHI
 A display should eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the user's mental resources,CHI
 This will allow the user to focus on current conditions and to consider possible future conditions,CHI
 An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination,CHI
Principle of consistency,CHI
 Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support the processing of new displays if they are designed consistently,CHI
 A user's long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate,CHI
 A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays,CHI
Social computing,CHI
Social computing is an interactive and collaborative behavior considered between technology and people,CHI
" In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis, as there are a lot of social computing technologies that include blogs, emails, social networking, quick messaging, and various others",CHI
" Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology",CHI
" For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name",CHI
" Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more negatively than humans, despite behaving the same way towards these machines",CHI
[21]Knowledge-driven humanâ€“computer interaction,CHI
"In human and computer interactions, a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors",CHI
" Ontology, as a formal representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem by solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties",CHI
Emotions and humanâ€“computer interaction,CHI
"HCI arose as a field from intertwined roots in computer graphics, operating systems, HF, ergonomics, industrial engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science",CHI
 The cognitive aspects of users will be discussed later in this article,CHI
"The early history of computer graphics, involving cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays and pen devices, led to the development of much of today's HCI techniques in the area of GUIs",CHI
 Sutherland's 1963 MIT doctoral thesis on Sketchpad essentially marked the beginning of computer graphics as a discipline,CHI
" This early work described direct-manipulation interaction techniques, where users performed actions on screen entities to represent commands",CHI
" The program allowed users to draw lines, circles, and points on a computer's CRT display using a light pen",CHI
" While these tasks are simple to program and use with today's computer hardware, software, and interfaces, nearly 40 years ago this was a revolutionary effort that required immense computing power",CHI
 Sutherland's program assigned characteristics to graphic objects and built relationships between objects,CHI
" Users could move, copy, scale, zoom, rotate objects, and save object characteristics",CHI
" Although this research never was commercially developed, most software engineers credit Sutherland's Sketchpad research and designs as the first step in the evolution of GUIs",CHI
"Early research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) produced a number of important building blocks for HCI, including the mouse, bitmapped displays, personal computers (PCs), windows, the desktop metaphor, and point-and-click editors",CHI
" The mouse, now a critical input device for most computer users, was developed in the late 1960s",CHI
" Douglas Engelbart began his work in 1964 on a handheld pointing device at SRI International in Menlo Park, CA, and carried on with his experimental designs at Xerox PARC",CHI
 The culmination of this work was the first patent for the wheel mouse in 1970,CHI
 Continued research and design on the mouse led to the patent for the ball mouse in 1974 by Xerox,CHI
" The idea came suddenly to Ron Rider, â€œI suggested that they turn a trackball upside down, make it small, and use it as a mouse instead",CHI
 Easiest patent I ever got,CHI
" It took me five minutes to think of, half an hour to describe to the attorney, and I was done",CHI
"â€‌ Apple Computer redesigned the mouse in 1979, using a rubber ball rather than a metal one",CHI
 Variations on the ball mouse are what GUI users mostly mouse with today,CHI
The first operating system designed around the GUI was a Xerox in-house computer system called the Alto in the early 1970s,CHI
" It had multiple, overlapping windows; used pop-up menus; and, of course, came with a mouse",CHI
" Around 1976, icons were added to the on-screen desktop",CHI
" The research and design of the Alto system led to the first commercial GUI product, the Xerox Star, in 1981",CHI
" The Xerox Star offered both tiled and overlapping windows, a menu bar for each window, and, of course, the mouse",CHI
 The Xerox Star was the first computer to follow the idea of the â€œdesktop metaphor,CHI
â€‌ The desktop metaphor is still the guiding metaphor for GUI today,CHI
Smith et al,CHI
" (1982) described the Xerox Star as, â€œEvery user's initial view of Star is the Desktop, which resembles the top of an office desk, together with surrounding furniture and equipment",CHI
" It represents a working environment, where current projects and accessible resources reside",CHI
" On the screen are displayed pictures of familiar office objects, such as documents, folders, file drawers, in-baskets, and out-baskets",CHI
" These objects are displayed as small pictures, or icons",CHI
â€‌ This is the beginning of the desktop metaphor that users now see on computer screens across the world,CHI
 Metaphors are further discussed later in this article,CHI
"The Xerox PARC engineers were successful at research and technology, but ultimately unsuccessful at developing commercial products",CHI
" The Xerox Star was never a success, even though over 30 man-years of work went into the product",CHI
 The development of the first successful GUI computer systems was left to Apple Computer,CHI
" The transition of research and technology to product development from Xerox to Apple was both a friendly and profitable one, as Xerox held 800,000 shares of Apple stock when it went public in December 1980",CHI
"Steven Jobs, a founder of Apple, visited Xerox PARC and viewed their research on graphical interfaces",CHI
 He returned to Apple very excited about GUIs and infused his design teams with that enthusiasm,CHI
 The rest is history,CHI
" The Apple Lisa, the precursor to the Macintosh, came out in 1983",CHI
" Like the Xerox Star, it was not a commercial success",CHI
" It took the introduction of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984, with a revolutionary advertising approach, to successfully bring GUIs to the computer market successfully",CHI
 Both the Lisa and the Macintosh had a menu bar for the entire screen and the first pull-down menus in a graphical interface,CHI
 An Apple designer received a patent for pull-down menus in 1984,CHI
Apple's success with the GUI is legendary and still remains the most familiar example of GUIs,CHI
" As I try to explain what GUIs are to unknowing computer users, I often say, â€œYou know, it's like the Apple Mac",CHI
"â€‌ After Apple's immense success with the Macintosh GUI, an operating system revolution was upon us, and both IBM and Microsoft went to work on PC-based GUIs of their own, along with a number of other software developers",CHI
 These companies had a lot of catching up to do and had to do it on a hardware platform very different from the Apple Macintosh,CHI
 One key advantage that Apple had is that they built the whole computer themselves as an integrated system,CHI
 Their design philosophy followed the Xerox PARC design methodology,CHI
 Jones described how the Xerox Star was built,CHI
 â€œStar began by defining a conceptual model of how users would relate to the system,CHI
" The interface was completed before the computer hardware had been built on which to run it, and two years before a single line of product software code had been written",CHI
â€‌ Many other software and hardware products failed in the marketplace because they did not follow this design approach,CHI
" Products and their interfaces should be designed for users, and the users should be involved in the product design process ",CHI
Responsiveness Principle 4: All delays are not equal: software need not do everything immediately,CHI
Some events require immediate feedback; some donâ€™t,CHI
 Software can therefore prioritize its handling of user events in order to give timely feedback where it is needed and delay other tasks,CHI
"As described above, for handâ€“eye coordination tasks, keystroke-level feedback must be immediate to be effective",CHI
" Internal bookkeeping, updating areas of the screen where users arenâ€™t working, results of explicitly requested calculations or searches need not be immediate",CHI
"The classic UI design handbook Humanâ€“Computer Interface Design Guidelines [Brown, 1988] uses the concept of task â€œclosureâ€‌ to determine when software response delays are acceptable or unacceptable",CHI
A key factor determining acceptable response delays is level of closureâ€¦,CHI
 A delay after completing a major unit of work may not bother a user or adversely affect performance,CHI
" Delays between minor steps in a larger unit of work, however, may cause the user to forget the next planned steps",CHI
" In general, actions with high levels of closure, such as saving a completed document to a file, are less sensitive to response time delays",CHI
" Actions at the lowest levels of closure, such as typing a character and seeing it echoed on the display, are most sensitive to response time delays",CHI
Trying to make all system responses equally fast cannot succeed,CHI
" Everything canâ€™t happen at once and even if it could, users couldnâ€™t perceive it all",CHI
Instant responses to certain user actions can even be undesirable,CHI
 Faster is not always better,CHI
 Users donâ€™t trust complex searches or computations that finish too quickly,CHI
" A slight delay, blink, animation, or other feedback may be needed when a display changes to make users notice the change or believe that work was done",CHI
 Many old computer games canâ€™t be played on todayâ€™s computers because they were optimized for maximum speed on slow computers and run too fast on newer ones,CHI
" Thus, the deadlines given for different types of feedback are not simply maximums, they are goals",CHI
"A manual examination of embedded systems utilizes human computer interfaces like key input and display output, to extract as much data as possible",CHI
 Reasons for choosing such a low-tech examination method include,CHI
"In some cases, speed is more important than forensic soundness",CHI
" If it is only important to know the value of the last trip counter of a car, it makes sense to switch on that car instead of spending a lot of time developing a forensically sound extraction procedure",CHI
With other methods it is not possible to extract certain evidence or to guarantee the integrity of certain data elements,CHI
" Some mobile phones for example, have data cable connection points inside the battery compartment",CHI
 Removing the battery to access these points may alter the date and time values of the phone,CHI
 If these values are expected to be important they can be extracted via the user menu of the phone,CHI
The conversion of extracted data into information (decoding) is problematic,CHI
" If no documentation is available on how specific data are formatted and all attempts to decode the data fail, the device itself might be a useful tool",CHI
" In a mobile phone examination for example, data related to deleted voice dialing commands were found but it was not possible to play these voice tags with any available sound player",CHI
" Through testing it was discovered how the phone coded the delete status of a voice tag and after flipping the deleted status data back to nondeleted, the voice tags could be played via the original phone",CHI
The investigator needs to have the technical documentation for the system and needs to be experienced in manual examination of the target device,CHI
 This will avoid data being unwittingly lost or affected,CHI
8 All the operations need to be documented and it must be stated in the final report that the data have been extracted manually,CHI
 Manual acquisition does not guarantee that all data are retrieved and also has the disadvantage of possible human (typographic) errors,CHI
" For computer assisted manual examinations, forensic tools exist that use a camera and computer software for documenting screen contents during a manual examination (Fernico, 2007; Project-a-Phone, 2007)",CHI
"During an investigation related to the death of a baby, a digital fever thermometer was examined",CHI
 The police wanted to know the last measured temperature,CHI
 After contacting the manufacturer and conducting tests with a reference device it turned out that the last measured temperature could be displayed by holding down the power button for a few seconds after powering on the device,CHI
Interactive Applications and Environments,CHI
Understanding the interaction between a computer and a human remains one of the enduring challenges in designing humanâ€“computer interfaces,CHI
 Visual cues are the most important mode of nonverbal communication,CHI
 Effective utilization of gestures and activities holds the promise of helping in creating computers that can better interact with humans,CHI
" Similarly, interactive environments such as smart rooms [12] that can react to a user's activities can benefit from vision-based methods",CHI
" However, such technologies are still not mature enough to stand the â€œTuring testâ€‌ and thus continue to attract research interest",CHI
The computer/human interface refers to the modalities through which people interact with computational technologies,CHI
" Looked at over the last half century, the trend has been from a style of interaction in which the computer is approached as a mechanism to a style of interaction in which the computer is approached as a behaving and aware organism",CHI
" This first trend has been related to another, from people acting directly on the machine to acting indirectly on its increasingly elaborate self presentation in which many layers of programming stand between underlying processes and what is presented to the user",CHI
 This movement is more than technical,CHI
" Computational technologies have served as objects to think with, that is, as carrier objects for ideas",CHI
" Through their changing interfaces, the computer has moved from being the carrier object of a culture of calculation to that of a culture of simulation",CHI
 The culture of simulation promotes a way of understanding in which users are encouraged to take computers â€کat interface value,CHI
Extending Visualization to Perceptualization: The Importance of Perception in Effective Communication of Information,CHI
 The essence of any humanâ€“computer interface is to convey information,CHI
 Visualization has been a good information communication tool for more than two decades,CHI
" While many visualization systems provide users with a better understanding of their data, they are often difficult to use and are not a reliable, accurate tool for conveying information, which limits their acceptance and use",CHI
" As scientists, medical researchers, and information analysts face drastic growth in the size of their datasets, the efficient, accurate, and reproducible communication of information becomes essential",CHI
 These problems become even worse when the datasets under investigation are multivariate and/or vector datasets,CHI
"Therefore, we need a fundamental change in the development of visualization techniques",CHI
 Traditional visualization must evolve into perceptualization of information: conveying information through multiple perceptual channels and perceptually tuned rendering techniques,CHI
" The choice of visual rendering techniques should be driven by characteristics of human perception, since perceptual channels are the communication medium",CHI
 This chapter summarizes some basics of human perception and show several examples of how this perceptual basis can be used to drive new perceptualization techniques,CHI
"Throughout history, humans have tried to effectively convey important information through the use of images, using techniques such as illustrations, photographs, and detailed technical drawings",CHI
 These techniques harness the enormous bandwidth and preattentive processing of the human visual system,CHI
" Many disciplines of study have evolved to further these techniques, including photography, technical and medical illustration, and now visualization",CHI
" While illustration and photography are both successful at capturing and conveying information, they utilize different techniques and characteristics of the human visual system to convey information",CHI
" Photography concentrates on conveying information with light and color variation, while illustration additionally tries to effectively convey information by omitting unimportant details, enhancing the most significant components of the image, simplifying complex features, and exposing hidden features ",CHI
 Scientific illustrations have been used for centuries because of their effective communicative ability ,CHI
"The effectiveness of illustration techniques, the amazing power of the human perceptual system, and the enormous data deluge facing information analysts, medical researchers, and scientific researchers have motivated us to explore the possible extension of visualization techniques to perceptualization",CHI
" The goal of perceptualization is to concisely convey information to the user through the creation of effective perceptual human inputs (visual, proprioceptive, and haptic)",CHI
Humanâ€“machine interfaces for medical imaging and clinical interventions,CHI
"16 Objective evaluation of performance on a task mediated by an interfaceBefore the advent of humanâ€“computer interfaces, Experimental Psychologists had known that the objective evaluation of performance on a task can be formulated by considering both the time (or speed) and the error rate (or accuracy) of the sequence of actions which make up the overarching task [25,33,31]",CHI
 They had also known that these are the only objective measures that can be made,CHI
" And more recently, due to the prevalent theories and empirical support of the speedâ€“accuracy trade-off, it has become recognized that these two measures cannot be disentangled",CHI
" Put succinctly and emphatically, â€œperformance of a task is the product of speed and accuracy, relative to that taskâ€‌",CHI
" (Within the HMI literature, this fundamental principle goes back as far as Fitts or perhaps Woodworth ",CHI
" What we would like to emphasize here is that there are no other objective metrics of performance (any other would either be noncausal correlate measures, or worse, be â€œsubjectiveâ€‌, and consequently prone to all of the cognitive and methodological biases that make subjective evaluations a very weak hand to play)",CHI
There is an easy Gedankenexperiment that can be conducted in this regard,CHI
" Pretend, for the sake of argument, that there might be, say, three objective metrics of performance: â€œSpeed, Accuracy, and Path Lengthâ€‌",CHI
" Well, then, what happens if your data shows that you have improved your speed and decreased your path length, but your accuracy is lower? Presumably that calls your performance into question",CHI
" And what if you have improved your accuracy and decreased your path length, but you have been much slower? Well, then, have you improved your performance by being much slower while taking a shorter path? Really? But now: what if you have improved your speed and your accuracy, but not your path length? Well, from the perspective of the task â€“ the increase in path length is irrelevant",CHI
" As long as your speed and accuracy are both better, then, by definition, your performance has improved",CHI
â€œPath lengthâ€‌ would only arise as a metric if it was explicitly made part of the goals of the task,CHI
" In this case, it would be a dual task, such as when you are asked to â€œpoint to a target while at the same time minimizing your path length",CHI
"â€‌ Then, in that case, you have two tasks â€“ and you can consider the speed and accuracy of both of those tasks, and then consider whether or not there exists a trade-off between accuracy constraints of the two tasks â€“ in which you will need to consider some weighting function if you need to extract a single performance measure from this dual task",CHI
" Alternately, you can extract performance metrics on the two aspects of the dual task",CHI
"This principle of objective performance metrics based on speed and accuracy can be applied hierarchically to any particular subtask of an overarching task; whether they comprised goal-directed movements, or discrete choice-based tasks (where in the discrete case, one considers the reciprocals of the task time and the error rate)",CHI
" While we have tried to provide an encompassing review of a broad area of research, we do hope that this article has been an argument that champions this particular emphatic point about the quantitative evaluation of humanâ€“machine interfaces for Medical Imaging, and Computer-Assisted Interventions",CHI
"Given the complexity of the humanâ€“computer interface, it is clear that evaluation protocols that address a large number of different types of speech-based input systems are required",CHI
" The majority of research in the area of speech-based input system evaluation has concentrated on evaluating system components, such as measuring the word recognition accuracy for a speech recognizer, rather than on overall effectiveness measures for complete systems",CHI
"In order to give the reader information on how to evaluate the performance of speech-based input systems, this section first introduces various performance measures, followed by discussions of the parameters that affect the performance",CHI
" The section then goes on to an evaluation framework, which includes high-level sophisticated metrics such as correction and transaction success",CHI
"To obtain a more detailed description of various evaluation techniques for speech-based input systems, readers are encouraged to refer to the handbook by Gibbon et al",CHI
"With some justification, one can see the evolution of the human-computer interface as a slow but relentless progress toward a more NUI-like interface: one that enables skillful performance rapidly without diminishing the result, and perhaps enhancing it",CHI
HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings,CHI
"As its name implies, HCI consists of three parts: the user, the computer itself, and the ways they work together",CHI
"By ""user"", we may mean an individual user, a group of users working together",CHI
" An appreciation of the way people's sensory systems (sight, hearing, touch) relay information is vital",CHI
" Also, different users form different conceptions or mental models about their interactions and have different ways of learning and keeping knowledge and",CHI
" In addition, cultural and national differences play a part",CHI
"When we talk about the computer, we're referring to any technology ranging from desktop computers, to large scale computer systems",CHI
" For example, if we were discussing the design of a Website, then the Website itself would be referred to as ""the computer""",CHI
 Devices such as mobile phones or VCRs can also be considered to be â€œcomputersâ€‌,CHI
There are obvious differences between humans and machines,CHI
" In spite of these, HCI attempts to ensure that they both get on with each other and interact successfully",CHI
" In order to achieve a usable system, you need to apply what you know about humans and computers, and consult with likely users throughout the design process",CHI
" In real systems, the schedule and the budget are important, and it is vital to find a balance between what would be ideal for the users and what is feasible in reality",CHI
The Goals of HCI,CHI
"The goals of HCI are to produce usable and safe systems, as well as functional systems",CHI
" In order o produce computer systems with good usability, developers must attempt to:",CHI
understand the factors that determine how people use technology,CHI
develop tools and techniques to enable building suitable systems,CHI
"achieve efficient, effective, and safe interactioN",CHI
put people first,CHI
Underlying the whole theme of HCI is the belief that people using a computer system should come first,CHI
" Their needs, capabilities and preferences for conducting various tasks should direct developers in the way that they design systems",CHI
 People should not have to change the way that they use a system in order to fit in with it,CHI
" Instead, the system should be designed to match their requirements",CHI
Usability is one of the key concepts in HCI,CHI
 It is concerned with making systems easy to learn and use,CHI
 A usable system is,CHI
easy to learn,CHI
easy to remember how to useMany everyday systems and products seem to be designed with little regard to usability,CHI
" This leads to frustration, wasted time and errors",CHI
" Productivity FactorsIncrease output, increase quality, decrease costs, decrease errors, increase innovation",CHI
Disciplines contributing to HCI,CHI
"The field of HCI covers a wide range of topics, and its development has relied on contributionsfrom many disciplines",CHI
 Some of the main disciplines which have contributed to HCI are:,CHI
"Computer Science technologyo software design, development & maintenance o User Interface Management Systems (UIMS) & User Interface Development Environments (UIDE) o prototyping tools o graphics",CHI
Cognitive Psychology information processing  capabilities limitations  cooperative working performance prediction,CHI
"Human-Computer Interaction is an interdisciplinary field of study interested in design, evaluation and implementation of interactive technology",CHI
" Since Human-Computer Interaction studies the interaction between human and computer, it is associated with the study fields suach as human behavior, psychology, cognitive science, computer science and software engineering as well as ergonomics, graphic and industrial design, sociology, anthropology and educational sciences [1]",CHI
"Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has four main components: the user, task, tools / interface, the context",CHI
 HCI studies requires the evaluation of obtained observations while the user performs certain tasks and habits of the user together,CHI
 These data are used in the development process of interactive systems,CHI
" After Vannevar Bush introduced the idea of theoretical analog computer (MEMEX: memory extender) in 1945, Shackel conducted the first studies in HCI field [2]",CHI
" In 1969, a periodical magazine ""International Journal of Man-Machine Studies"" was founded, in the 1970s ""user friendly"" (user-friendliness) concept was introduced, in 1976 NATO was sponsor for the ""Man-Computer Interaction"" related workshop",CHI
"Weinberg and Shneiderman have published the first book on the subject during these years [3, 4]",CHI
 In 1982 the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) launched the of SIGCH (Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction) and CHI (International Conference for Human-Computer Interaction) conferences,CHI
" In the late 1980s, four major magazines in the field of Human-Computer Interaction were continued to be published",CHI
" During this period, the first industrial Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory was established,  in the 1990s with the development of web technologies, the importance of the HCI studies was increased and user-centered design began to come forward rather than technical/designer-centered design",CHI
" Towards the end of 90s, the first HCI academic programs have been initiated in universities such as Carnegie Mellon University, Indiana University",CHI
The world of computing has evolved really fast with passing time,CHI
" From data centres, we moved to the cloud, then to the edge and we are sure that much more is still going to come",CHI
" We got introduced to 3D printing and virtual and augmented reality applications, some of which completely changed our lives",CHI
" As discussing augmented reality, learn top trends in AR",CHI
"From the AI assistant on our phones to that speaker looking thing that can turn off the lights of your room on one single command of yours, technology has no barriers nowadays",CHI
" But in between this technical revolution we must admit that the interaction and communications with technology is not always that easy, remember getting annoyed because of your phoneâ€™s autocorrect feature? Thatâ€™s what I am talking about",CHI
 The keyboard that was not easy to communicate with was suffering from a poor Human-computer interaction design,CHI
 Do you know what it is? This blog is all about the thing mentioned above,CHI
Human-Computer Interaction(HCI),CHI
The study of how computer technology affects human labour and activities is known as Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI),CHI
" The word ""computer technology"" currently encompasses a wide range of devices, from traditional computers with displays and keyboards to smartphones, home appliances, in-car navigation systems, and even integrated sensors and actuators like automated lighting",CHI
" HCI is linked to a design field known as Interaction Design or User-Centered Design, which focuses on how to make computer technology as simple and enjoyable to use as possible",CHI
" The concept of ""usability,"" which is generally characterised in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction, is an important part of the design profession",CHI
"Because it currently encompasses practically all types of information technology, the definition of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) must remain wide (IT)",CHI
 The study of creating computers and technologies to best serve their users is known as human-computer interaction (HCI) (i,CHI
e,CHI
 humans),CHI
 HCI is closely connected to User Experience (UX) design and is widely regarded as the forerunner of this more current approach,CHI
Evolution of Human-Computer Interaction,CHI
"Since its beginning, the area of Human-Computer Interaction has expanded considerably",CHI
" To operate the early personal computers (PCs), you needed a lot of training and, predictably, there were a lot of problems in the user experience",CHI
" Simple operations like moving the mouse or erasing text faced users with never-before-seen problems, all of which posed major barriers to the computer's use",CHI
"In the early 1980s, HCI emerged as an attempt to understand how and why computers could be made more user-friendly",CHI
 The subject of research soon expanded to encompass nearly all aspects of information technology,CHI
Importance of Human-Computer Interaction,CHI
"HCI is critical since it will be necessary for goods to be more successful, safe, helpful, and functional",CHI
 It will make the user's experience more enjoyable in the long term,CHI
" As a result, having someone with HCI skills involved in all phases of any product or system development is critical",CHI
 HCI is also necessary to prevent goods or projects from failing completely,CHI
"When creating clear intuitive systems that will be accessible by people with a wide variety of talents and knowledge, as well as those who have not finished any official training, HCI is critical",CHI
 HCI makes software and gadgets more intelligible and useful for everyone by leveraging our everyday knowledge of the environment,CHI
" As everyone has used genuine paper folders in their daily lives, displaying a visual of a small folder in a computer's interface helps the user comprehend the folder's purpose",CHI
" Finally, if a system is well-designed using HCI approaches, the user should not have to worry about the system's complexities",CHI
" Clear, straightforward, and natural interaction should be the norm",CHI
"Today, technology has infiltrated every area of our life",CHI
" Even if a person does not directly own or use a computer, computers have an impact on their lives",CHI
" ATM machines, railway ticket selling machines, and hot beverage vending machines are just a few examples of computer interfaces that people may interact with on a regular basis without having to possess a computer",CHI
" When creating any of these systems or interfaces, human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial, whether designing an interface for an ATM or a desktop computer, HCI principles should be examined and taken into account to guarantee that the interface is safe, useful, and efficient",CHI
 HCI is significant for any company that relies on technology or computers in its day-to-day operations,CHI
 Staff are more content and productive when working with well-designed usable systems since they are not irritated,CHI
 HCI is particularly essential in the design of safety-critical systems like those found in power plants and air traffic control centres,CHI
" In these instances, design flaws can have catastrophic consequences, including the death of many individual",CHI
"When building systems that are not just functional but also accessible to persons with impairments, human-computer interaction (HCI) is a critical factor to consider",CHI
" HCI's basic idea is to offer everyone with secure, usable, and efficient systems, which includes people with a wide variety of abilities and levels of experience and knowledge",CHI
 Any system that is built using HCI user-centered approaches and concepts will be as accessible as possible to people with impairments,CHI
"Today, only a small percentage of computer users read the software's documentation, assuming one exists",CHI
 Only the most specialist and complex programmes need intensive training and a handbook,CHI
"Within a few minutes of engaging with a computer software, consumers expect to grasp its basic features",CHI
" HCI equips designers with the ideas, strategies, and resources they need to create intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces that don't require training",CHI
Virtual reality is an excellent example of human-computer interaction in the workplace,CHI
 The interaction between the computer and the user is meant to provide the user a new viewpoint,CHI
" Virtual reality, when done correctly, can genuinely resemble the actual environment, and is an excellent example of good HCI at action",CHI
" Voice search, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Voice Search, is another example",CHI
 These voice search apps and gadgets allow users to engage with a device or system that guides them to an Amazon purchase or a Google search,CHI
"On an end-note, if we look at the future of Human-computer interaction, we will find that the things ahead are going to be really exciting",CHI
 Looking into the possibilities of where HCI may lead us might seem like you're reading a science fiction storey,CHI
" That's because HCI wants technology to be as normal and accessible as possible in our daily lives, giving us a glimpse into an apparently futuristic future",CHI
"When utilising virtual reality, Dexta haptic gloves were created to simulate touch feelings of hardness, softness, springiness, and more",CHI
" As the user interacts with things in their VR experience, the gloves replicate these feelings by locking and unlocking the user's finger joints to various degrees",CHI
" As indicating VR applications here, learn the applications of VR in the military",CHI
Pre-touch sensing,CHI
It enables your smartphone to read your thoughts (almost),CHI
" When they first come out, pre-touch phones should be able to detect how the user holds the phone or which fingers approach the screen in order to forecast what the user intends to do",CHI
 This gives the impression that your phone can read your mind since it executes things before you give it a clear instruction,CHI
"hether you are a seasoned Designer (have webmaster in your CV) or new to the world of digital software product design (UXD, UXR, UI, IxD, IA, CX, LX, VD, FE, SO, PO, ML, AI, etc) the universe in which you can apply your craft and skills are continuing to grow",CHI
" Letâ€™s review the paradigms that construct how we think about, design for, develop in, and deploy software for people all around the globe",CHI
Human interactions options,CHI
"Human Interaction optionsIn 2021, we interact with computers like it is oxygen",CHI
" At one point not that long ago we did not interact with computers daily; however, humans are quick to invent and quick to adapt to new systems that improve their lives",CHI
" The computer has been a dominant force in our day-to-day existence, and the ways we interact with computers have changed over time",CHI
 Computers and software are fundamentally supported by the ways humans can interact with each other in the world,CHI
Sight: We use our eyes to look at screens or other user interfaces and content to make decisions to execute a task,CHI
"Touch: We use the dexterity in your hands to operate a user interface including buttons, keyboards, and feel haptic (vibrational) feedback, and more from our computer devices",CHI
Hearing: Sound is used as feedback for usage both in content (music/video) as well as to indicate actions and proprietary sounds of a user interface,CHI
"Voice: We speak to communicate actions, feelings, and commands",CHI
 Voice interfaces learn these commands and train their users to make specific commands to accomplish tasks,CHI
Spatial: We move around space both in the world and in terms of our computer systems,CHI
 Interfaces can respond to macro movements (location on the planet) vs micro-movements waving hands or thumbs up etc to control an interface,CHI
"These sensing abilities are thus enhanced and augmented by a computer allow us to see, touch, hear, speak, and move in space with greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy because of a computer",CHI
The number of hardware options is continuing to grow but the vast number of computer usage can be bucketed into 3 types,CHI
"Desktop (Monitor, Computer Tower, Keyboard, Mouse)",CHI
"Laptop (Monitor + Keyboard + Trackpad),Touch screen (Mobile/Tablet)",CHI
"Now, of course, computers are embedded into our lives in such large ways including vehicles, consumer electronics, gaming devices, and the internet of things devices",CHI
 Increasingly the distinction between what has a computer and what doesnâ€™t is harder to distinguish,CHI
Computer software categories,CHI
"Computer software has endless permutations and is deeply ingrained into every aspect of our lives from ordering food, to scheduling an event with your family",CHI
" The software can be deployed in many ways but with the proliferation of the internet and handheld computers, we are starting to see the execution of 3 types of software delivery types",CHI
 Native Platform Software â€” You might understand this as Apple vs PC and software that is made just for those ecosystems and operating systems,CHI
Hybrid Cloud Software â€” Large enterprise SaaS companies are adopting this strategy to tackle both the complexity of security as well as stand up their existing business models,CHI
" Companies like IBM, Deloitte, and Oracle all use some version of hybrid deployment of software and data protection",CHI
 Cloud Software/Browser-Software â€” With high-speed internet and improved internet browsers software doesnâ€™t require being locked in your individual computer rather it can be managed and executed in the cloud and a software user can access the software from any internet-connected computer,CHI
" Companies like Figma, Google Docs, and Salesforce, etc all create software through the browser",CHI
Software is what elevates our computers to the level of utility,CHI
" From google maps to banking software allows us to go places, buy things, and keep the systems moving and our societies humming",CHI
 Software at the minimum should be usable,CHI
 When software is done well it is also accessible to all users and when it is really good it is a delightful user experience for all its users,CHI
 The goal of anyone making software should be to make what their users actually want,CHI
" Easier said than done but if we fundamentally hold that software is for humanâ€™s then we should make sure our software is infused with humanity from research to UX to the user interface, and through to the data that is gathered",CHI
Computer Artificial Intelligence,CHI
Categories of Artificial Intelligence,CHI
"Computer software has a huge impact on making our hardware useful, usable, accessible, and hopefully delightful",CHI
 This has also lead to improved computer processing power which has ushered in the scalability of artificial intelligence,CHI
" AI software is used to manage, crunch, and make sense of large amounts of data as well as other applications",CHI
" AI can be integrated into existing software tools like auto-correct or spell check or can be autonomous systems like robots or chatbots, or automated customer service emails, etc",CHI
 AI can be bucketing into 5 branches within computer science and is a rapidly growing field,CHI
Natural Language Processing (NLP)â€” The ability to give computers the ability to understand the text and speak words in much the same way human beings can,CHI
" Products like Alexa, Siri, or Google Translate all rely on being able to intake voice and produce a result",CHI
"Humans, computers, and artificial intelligence should be leaned on for what they do best",CHI
" Allow humans to focus on creativity, design, communication, and value",CHI
" Allow computers to focus on computation, processes, and data collections",CHI
 Allow AI to focus on mining the data and making processes more efficient,CHI
 By focusing on these and many other aspects it will allow the vast set of skilled humans who build these systems to be more creative,CHI
 Our complex systems can hopefully be designed to free up skilled humans to tackle even more difficult problems,CHI
" From a cure for cancer to climate modeling, our ability to integrate and utilize computer paradigms will continue to support and require highly skilled professionals as the engine that drives its success and ability to continue to change our world",CHI
"Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI), alternatively manâ€“machine interaction (MMI) or computerâ€“human interaction (CHI) is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers",CHI
" With today's technology and tools, and our motivation to create really effective and usable interfaces and screens, why do we continue to produce systems that are inefficient and confusing or, at worst, just plain unusable? Is it because: 1",CHI
 We don't care? 2,CHI
 We don't possess common sense? 3,CHI
 We don't have the time? 4,CHI
 We still don't know what really makes good design? DEFINITION ,CHI
"Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them. GOALS ",CHI
A basic goal of HCI is â€“ to improve the interactions between users and computers â€“ by making computers more usable and receptive to the user's needs,CHI
  A long term goal of HCI is â€“ to design systems that minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they want â€“ to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's task WHY IS HCI IMPORTANT ,CHI
 User-centered design is getting a crucial role! ,CHI
" It is getting more important today to increase competitiveness via HCI studies (Norman, 1990) ",CHI
 High-cost e-transformation investments ,CHI
 Users lose time with badly designed products and services ,CHI
Users even give up using bad interface â€“ Ineffective allocation of resources 3 DEFINING THE USER INTERFACE ,CHI
" User interface, design is a subset of a field of study called human-computer interaction (HCI)",CHI
"  Human-computer interaction is the study, planning, and design of how people and computers work together so that a person's needs are satisfied in the most effective way",CHI
" HCI designers must consider a variety of factors: â€“ what people want and expect, physical limitations and abilities people possess, --how information processing systems work, â€“ what people find enjoyable and attractive",CHI
 â€“ Technical characteristics and limitations of the computer hardware and software must also be considered,CHI
"  The user interface is to â€“ the part of a computer and its software that people can see, hear, touch, talk to, or otherwise understand or direct",CHI
 The user interface has essentially two components: input and output,CHI
 â€¢ Input is how a person communicates his / her needs to the computer,CHI
" â€“ Some common input components are the keyboard, mouse, trackball, one's finger, and one's voice",CHI
  Output is how the computer conveys the results of its computations and requirements to the user,CHI
" â€“ Today, the most common computer output mechanism is the display screen, followed by mechanisms that take advantage of a person's auditory capabilities: voice and sound",CHI
  The use of the human senses of smell and touch output in interface design still remain largely unexplored,CHI
" â€¢ Proper interface design will provide a mix of well-designed input and output mechanisms that satisfy the user's needs, capabilities, and limitations in the most effective way possible",CHI
" â€¢ The best interface is one that it not noticed, one that permits the user to focus on the information and task at hand, not the mechanisms used to present the information and perform the task",CHI
" 4 THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD DESIGN With today's technology and tools, and our motivation to create really effective and usable interfaces and screens, why do we continue to produce systems that are inefficient and confusing or, at worst, just plain unusable? Is it because: We don't care? We don't possess common sense? ",CHI
 We don't have the time? ,CHI
We still don't know what really makes good design? ,CHI
" But we never seem to have time to find out what makes good design, nor to properly apply it",CHI
" After all, many of us have other things to do in addition to designing interfaces and screens",CHI
  So we take our best shot given the workload and time constraints imposed upon us,CHI
" The result, too often, is woefully inadequate",CHI
" â€¢ Interface and screen design were really a matter of common sense, we developers would have been producing almost identical screens for representing the real world",CHI
 â€¢ Example bad designs â€“ Closed door with complete wood â€“ suggestion : glass door THE IMPORTANCE OF THE USER INTERFACE  A well-designed interface and screen is terribly important to our users,CHI
 It is theirïƒک window to view the capabilities of the system,CHI
  It is also the vehicle through which many critical tasks are presented,CHI
" These tasksïƒک often have a direct impact on an organization's relations with its customers, and its profitability",CHI
  A screen's layout and appearance affect a person in a variety of ways,CHI
" If they areïƒک confusing and inefficient, people will have greater difficulty in doing their jobs and will make more mistakes",CHI
  Poor design may even chase some people away from a system permanently,CHI
" It canïƒک also lead to aggravation, frustration, and increased stress",CHI
 The Benefits of Good Design  Poor clarity forced screen users to spend one extra second per screen,CHI
ïƒک o Almost one additional year would be required to process all screens,CHI
 o Twenty extra seconds in screen usage time adds an additional 14 person years,CHI
 5  The benefits of a well designed screen have also been under experimental scrutinyïƒک for many years,CHI
" o One researcher, for example, attempted to improve screen clarity and readability by making screens less crowded",CHI
" o Separate items, which had been combined on the same display line to conserve space, were placed on separate lines instead",CHI
 o The result screen users were about 20 percent more productive with the less crowded version,CHI
  Proper formatting of information on screens does have a significant positive effectïƒک on performance,CHI
" o In recent years, the productivity benefits of well-designed Web pages have also been scrutinized",CHI
  Training costs are lowered because training time is reduced,CHI
 support line costs are lowered because fewer assist calls are necessary,CHI
Employee satisfaction is increased because aggravation and frustration are reduced,CHI
  Identifying and resolving problems during the design and development process alsoïƒک has significant economic benefits  How many screens are used each day in our technological world?ïƒک  How many screens are used each day in your organization? Thousands? Millions?ïƒک  Imagine the possible savings,CHI
" Proper screen design might also, of course, lower theïƒک costs of replacing ""broken"" PCs",CHI
 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACE The need for people to communicate with each other has existed since we first walked upon this planet,CHI
  The lowest and most common level of communication modes we share are movements and gestures,CHI
" Movements and gestures are language independent, that is, they permit people who do not speak the same language to deal with one another",CHI
" 6  The next higher level, in terms of universality and complexity, is spoken language",CHI
" Most people can speak one language, some two or more",CHI
 A spoken language is a very efficient mode of communication if both parties to the communication understand it,CHI
 At the third and highest level of complexity is written language,CHI
" While most people speak, not all can write",CHI
"But for those who can, writing is still nowhere near as efficient a means of communication as speaking",CHI
"  In modem times, we have the typewriter, another step upward in communication complexity",CHI
 Significantly fewer people type than write,CHI
" (While a practiced typist can find typing faster and more efficient than handwriting, the unskilled may not find this the case",CHI
" Spoken language, however, is still more efficient than typing, regardless' of typing skill level",CHI
"  Through its first few decades, a computer's ability to deal with human communication was inversely related to what was easy for people to do",CHI
" o The computer demanded rigid, typed input through a keyboard; people responded slowly using this device and with varying degrees of skill",CHI
" o The human-computer dialog reflected the computer's preferences, consisting of one style or a combination of styles using keyboards, commonly referred to as Command Language, Question and Answer, Menu selection, Function Key Selection, and Form Fill-In",CHI
" â€¢ Throughout the computer's history, designers have been developing, with varying degrees of success, other human-computer interaction methods that utilize more general, widespread, and easier-to-learn capabilities: voice and handwriting",
"  Systems that recognize human speech and handwriting now exist,ï‚§ although they still lack the universality and richness of typed input",CHI
 INTRODUCTION OF THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE ,CHI
" The Xerox systems, Altus and STAR, introduced the mouse and pointing and selecting as the primary human-computer communication method",CHI
"  The user simply pointed at the screen, using the mouse as an intermediary",CHI
" 7  These systems also introduced the graphical user interface as we know it a new concept was born, revolutionizing the human-computer interface",CHI
" A BRIEF HISTORY OF SCREEN DESIGN â€¢ While developers have been designing screens since a cathode ray tube display was first attached to a computer, more widespread interest in the application of good design principles to screens did not begin to emerge until the early 1970s, when IBM introduced its 3270 cathode ray tube text-based terminal",CHI
 â€¢ A 1970s screen often resembled the one pictured in Figure,CHI
 It usually consisted of many fields (more than are illustrated here) with very cryptic and often unintelligible captions,CHI
" â€¢ It was visually cluttered, and often possessed a command field that challenged the user to remember what had to be keyed into it",CHI
  Ambiguous messages often required referral to a manual to interpret,CHI
  Effectively using this kind of screen required a great deal of practice and patience,CHI
" Most early screens were monochromatic, typically presenting green text on black backgrounds",CHI
" At the turn of the decade guidelines for text-based screen design were finally made widely available and many screens began to take on a much less cluttered look through concepts such as grouping and alignment of elements, as illustrated in Figure 1",CHI
2,CHI
" 8 â€¢ User memory was supported by providing clear and meaningful field captions and by listing commands on the screen, and enabling them to be applied, through function keys",CHI
 Messages also became clearer,CHI
" â€¢ These screens were not entirely clutter-free, however",CHI
 Instructions and reminders to the user had to be inscribed on the screen in the form of prompts or completion aids such as the codes PR and Sc,CHI
" â€¢ Not all 1980s screens looked like this, however",CHI
" In the 1980s, 1970s-type screens were still being designed, and many still reside in systems today",CHI
"  The advent of graphics yielded another milestone in the evolution of screen design, as illustrated in Figure above While some basic ""design principles did not change, groupings and alignment, for example, Borders were made available to visually enhance groupings and buttons and menus for implementing commands replaced function keys",CHI
" 9 â€¢ Multiple properties of elements were also provided, including many different font sizes and styles, line thicknesses, and colors",CHI
" â€¢ The entry field was supplemented by a multitude of other kinds of controls, including list boxes, drop-down combination boxes, spin boxes, and so forth",CHI
" â€¢ These new controls were much more effective in supporting a person's memory, now simply allowing for selection from a list instead of requiring a remembered key entry",CHI
" â€¢ Completion aids disappeared from screens, replaced by one of the new listing controls",CHI
" Screens could also be simplified, the much more powerful computers being able to quickly present a new screen",CHI
 EARLIER DIRECT MANIPULATION SYSTEMS o The concept of direct manipulation actually preceded the first graphical system,CHI
 The earliest full-screen text editors possessed similar characteristics,CHI
 o Screens of text resembling a piece of paper on one's desk could be created (extension of real world) and then reviewed in their entirety (continuous visibility),CHI
 o Editing or restructuring could be easily accomplished (through rapid incremental actions) and the results immediately seen,CHI
 o Actions could be reversed when necessary,CHI
" It took the advent of graphical systems to crystallize the direct manipulation concept, however",CHI
" INDIRECT MANIPULATION In practice, direct manipulation of all screen objects and actions may not be feasible because of the following: 13 The operation may be difficult to conceptualize in the graphical system",CHI
  The graphics capability of the system may be limited,CHI
  The amount of space available for placing manipulation controls in the window border may be limited,CHI
  It may be difficult for people to learn and remember all the necessary operations and actions,CHI
"  When this occurs, indirect manipulation is provided",CHI
" Indirect manipulation substitutes words and text, such as pull-down or pop-up menus, for symbols, and substitutes typing for pointing",CHI
  Most window systems are a combination of both direct and indirect manipulation,CHI
 A menu may be accessed by pointing at a menu icon and then selecting it (direct manipulation),CHI
"  The menu itself, however, is a textual list of operations (indirect manipulation)",CHI
" When an operation is selected from the list, by pointing or typing, the system executes it as a command",CHI
"  Which style of interaction-direct manipulation, indirect manipulation, or a combination of both-is best, under what conditions and for whom, remains a question whose answer still eludes us",CHI
 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE A graphical system possesses a set of defining concepts,CHI
" Included are sophisticated visual Presentation, pick-and click interaction, a restricted set of interface options, visualization, object orientation, extensive use of a person's recognition memory, and concurrent performance of functions Sophisticated Visual Presentation: Visual presentation is the visual aspect of the interface",CHI
 It is what people see on the screen,CHI
" The sophistication of a graphical system permits displaying lines, including drawings and icons",CHI
"  It also permits the displaying of a variety of character fonts, including different sizes and styles",CHI
 The display of 16 million or more colors is possible on some screens,CHI
 Graphics also permit animation and the presentation of photograph and motion video,CHI
" 14 The meaningful interface elements visually presented to the user in a graphical System include windows (primary, secondary, or dialog boxes), menus (menu bar, pull down, popup, cascading), icons to represent objects such as programs or files, assorted screen-based controls (text boxes, list boxes, combination boxes, settings, scroll bar and buttons), and a mouse pointer and cursor",CHI
" -- The objective is to reflect visually on screen the real world of the user as realistically, meaningfully, simply, and clearly possible",CHI
 A graphical system possesses a set of defining concepts,CHI
" Included are sophisticated visual presentation, pick-andclick interaction, a restricted set of interface options, visualization, object orientation, extensive use of a person's recognition memory, and concurrent performance of functions",CHI
" Restricted Set of Interface Options: The array of alternatives available to the user is what is presented on the screen or may be retrieved through what is presented on the screen, nothing less, nothing more",CHI
 This concept fostered the acronym WYSIWYG,CHI
 Pick-and-Click Interaction: Elements of a graphical screen upon which some action is to be performed must first identified,CHI
" o The motor activity required of a person to identify this element for a proposed action is commonly referred to as pick, the signal to perform an action as cue",CHI
 o The primary mechanism for performing this pick-and-click is most often the mouse and its buttons,CHI
 o The user moves the mouse pointer to the relevant element (pick) and the action is signaled (click),CHI
 o Pointing allows rapid selection and feedback,CHI
 The hand and mind seem to work smoothly and efficiently together,CHI
 o The secondary mechanism for performing these selection actions is the keyboard most systems permit pick-and-click to be performed using the keyboard as well,CHI
 Visualization: Visualization is a cognitive process that allows people to understand ,CHI
"Information that is difficult to perceive, because it is either too voluminous or too abstract Presenting specialized graphic portrayals facilitates visualization",CHI
 The best visualization method for an activity depends on what People are trying to learn from the data,CHI
" 15 The goal is not necessarily to reproduce a really graphical image, but to produce one that conveys the most relevant information",CHI
" Effective visualizations can facilitate mental insights, increase productivity, and for faster and more accurate use of data",CHI
 Object Orientation: A graphical system consists of objects and actions,CHI
 Objects are what people see on screen,CHI
 They are manipulated as a single unit,CHI
  Objects can be composed of sub objects,CHI
" For example, an object may be a document",CHI
" The document's sub objects may be a paragraph, sentence, word, and letter",CHI
  A collection is the simplest relationship-the objects sharing a common aspect,CHI
  A collection might be the result of a query or a multiple selection of objects,CHI
 Operations can be applied to a collection of objects,CHI
  A constraint is a stronger object relationship,CHI
 Changing an object in a set affects some other object in the set,CHI
  A document being organized into pages is an example of a constraint,CHI
 A composite exists when the relationship between objects becomes so significant that the aggregation itself can be identified as an object,CHI
"  Examples include a range of cells organized into a spreadsheet, or a collection of words organized into a paragraph",CHI
 A container is an object in which other objects exist,CHI
 Examples include text in a document  or documents in a folder,CHI
 A container often influences the behavior of its content,CHI
" It may add or suppress certain properties or operations of objects placed within it, control access to its content, or control access to kinds of objects it will accept",CHI
 These relationships help define an object's type,CHI
 Similar traits and behaviors exist in objects of the same object type,CHI
 Another important object characteristic is persistence,CHI
 Persistence is the maintenance of a state once it is established,CHI
" An object's state (for example, window size, cursor location, scroll position, and so on) should always be automatically preserved when the user changes it",CHI
 16 Use of Recognition Memory: Continuous visibility of objects and actions encourages use of a person's more powerful recognition memory,CHI
" The ""out of sight, out of mind"" problem is eliminated CONCURRENT PERFORMANCE OF FUNCTIONS Graphic systems may do two or more things at one time",CHI
 Multiple programs may run simultaneously,CHI
" When a system is not busy on a primary task, it may process background tasks (cooperative multitasking)",CHI
"When applications are running as truly separate tasks, the system may divide the processing power into time slices and allocate portions to each application",CHI
 Data may also be transferred between programs,CHI
" It may be temporarily stored on a ""clipboard"" for later transfer or be automatically swapped between programs",CHI
 THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE  A user interface is a collection of techniques and mechanisms to interact with something,CHI
  In a graphical interface the primary interaction mechanism is a pointing device of some kind,CHI
  This device is the electronic equivalent to the human hand,CHI
 What the user interacts with is a collection of elements referred to as objects,CHI
"  They can be seen, heard, touched, or otherwise perceived",CHI
  Objects are always visible to the user and are used to perform tasks,CHI
 They are interacted with as entities independent of all other objects,CHI
"People perform operations, called actions, on objects",CHI
" The operations include accessing and modifying objects by pointing, selecting, and manipulating",CHI
 All objects have standard resulting behaviors,CHI
 THE WEB USER INTERFACE The expansion of the World Wide Web since the early 1990s has been truly amazing,CHI
" Once simply a communication medium for scientists and researchers, its many and pervasive tentacles have spread deeply into businesses, organizations, and homes around the world",CHI
" Unlike earlier text-based and GUI systems that were developed and nurtured in an organization's Data Processing and Information Systems groups, the Web's roots were sown in a market-driven society thirsting for convenience and information",CHI
 Web interface design is essentially the design of navigation and the presentation of information,CHI
" It is about content, not data",CHI
" Proper interface design is largely a matter of properly balancing the structure and relationships of menus, content, and other linked documents or graphics",CHI
" The design goal is 17 to build a hierarchy of menus and pages that feels natural, is well structured, is easy to use, and is truthful",CHI
" The Web is a navigation environment where people move between pages of information, not an application environment",CHI
 It is also a graphically rich environment,CHI
 Web interface design is difficult for a number of reasons,CHI
" First, its underlying design language, HTML, was never intended for creating screens to be used by the general population",CHI
 Its scope of users was expected to be technical,CHI
 HTML was limited in objects and interaction styles and did not provide a means for presenting information in the most effective way for people,CHI
" Next, browser navigation retreated to the pre-GUI era",CHI
" This era was characterized by a ""command"" field whose contents had to be learned, and a navigational organization and structure that lay hidden beneath a mostly dark and blank screen",CHI
" GUIs eliminated the absolute necessity for a command field, providing menus related to the task and the current contextual situation",CHI
" Browser navigation is mostly confined to a ""Back"" and ""Forward"" concept, but ""back-to where"" and ""forward-towhere"" is often unremembered or unknown",CHI
" Web interface design is also more difficult because the main issues concern information Architecture and task flow, neither of which is easy to standardize",CHI
" It is more difficult because of the availability of the various types of multimedia, and the desire of many designers to use something simply because it is available",CHI
" It is more difficult because users are ill defined, and the user's tools so variable in nature",CHI
" The ultimate goal of a Web that feels natural, is well structured, and is easy to use will reach fruition",CHI
" THE POPULARITY OF THE WEB While the introduction of the graphical user interface revolutionized the user interface, the Web has revolutionized computing",CHI
" It allows millions of people scattered across the globe to communicate, access information, publish, and be heard",CHI
 â€¢ It allows people to control much of the display and the rendering of Web pages,CHI
" 18 Aspects such as typography and colors can be changed, graphics turned off, and decisions made whether or not to transmit certain data over non secure channels or whether to accept or refuse cookies",CHI
 Web usage has reflected this popularity,CHI
" The number of Internet hosts has risen dramatically:  In 1984, hosts online exceeded 1,000;  in 1987, 10,000;  in 1989, 100,000,  in 1990, 300,000; in 1992 hosts exceeded one million",CHI
  Commercialization of the Internet saw even greater expansion of the growth rate,CHI
" In 1993, Internet traffic was expanding at a 341,634 percent annual growth rate",CHI
" In 1996, there were nearly 10 million hosts online and 40 million connected people (PBS Timeline)",CHI
  User control has had some decided disadvantages for some Web site owners as well,CHI
  Users have become much more discerning about good design,CHI
" Slow download times, confusing navigation, confusing page organization, disturbing animation, or other undesirable site features often results in user abandonment of the site for others with a more agreeable interface",CHI
"  People are quick to vote with their mouse, and these warnings should not go unheeded",CHI
 GUI VERSUS WEB PAGE DESIGN,CHI
,DS
" Its popularity has grown over the years, and companies have started implementing data science techniques to grow their business and increase customer satisfaction",DS
" In this article, weâ€™ll learn what data science is, and how you can become a data scientist",DS
 What is Data Science,DS
"Lifecycle, Applications, PrerequisitesPreviousNext",DS
"Now that you know what is data science, next up let us focus on the data science lifecycle",DS
" Data scienceâ€™s lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks:Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction",DS
 This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data,DS
"Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture",DS
 This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used,DS
"Process: Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization",DS
" Data scientists take the prepared data and examine its patterns, ranges, and biases to determine how useful it will be in predictive analysi",DS
"Analyze: Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis",DS
 Here is the real meat of the lifecycle,DS
 This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data,DS
"Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making",DS
" In this final step, analysts prepare the analyses in easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports",DS
Prerequisites for Data Science,DS
Here are some of the technical concepts you should know about before starting to learn what is data science,DS
 Machine learning is the backbone of data science,DS
 Data Scientists need to have a solid grasp of ML in addition to basic knowledge of statistics,DS
 Modeling,DS
Mathematical models enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data,DS
 Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem and how to train these models,DS
 Statistics,DS
Statistics are at the core of data science,DS
 A sturdy handle on statistics can help you extract more intelligence and obtain more meaningful results,DS
Programming,DS
Some level of programming is required to execute a successful data science project,DS
" The most common programming languages are Python, and R",DS
" Python is especially popular because itâ€™s easy to learn, and it supports multiple libraries for data science and ML",DS
 Databases,DS
"A capable data scientist needs to understand how databases work, how to manage them, and how to extract data from them",DS
"What is Data Science: Lifecycle, Applications, Prerequisites and Tools",DS
"Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions",DS
 Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models,DS
The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats,DS
"Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together datascience programs, and publications are touting data science as a hotâ€”even â€کâ€کsexyâ€™â€™â€”career choice",DS
" However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz",DS
" In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science",DS
" One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making",DS
 Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitionerâ€™s field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field,DS
 We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance,DS
" We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science",DS
" Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer",DS
" Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science",DS
" In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts",DS
" We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science",DS
" With vast amounts of data now available, companies in almost every industry are focused on exploiting data for competitive advantage",DS
" The volume and variety of data have far outstripped the capacity of manual analysis, and in some cases have exceeded the capacity of conventional databases",DS
" At the same time, computers have become far more powerful, networking is ubiquitous, and algorithms have been developed that can connect datasets to enable broader and deeper analyses than previously possible",DS
 The convergence of these phenomena has given rise to the increasingly widespread business application of data science,DS
 Companies across industries have realized that they need to hire more data scientists,DS
 Academic institutions are scrambling to put together programs to train data scientists,DS
 Publications are touting data science as a hot career choice and even sexy,DS
" At a high level, data science is a set of fundamental principles that support and guide the principled extraction of information and knowledge from data",DS
 Possibly the most closely related concept to data science is data miningâ€”the actual extraction of knowledge from data via technologies that incorporate these principles,DS
" There are hundreds of different data-mining algorithms, and a great deal of detail to the methods of the field",DS
 We argue that underlying all these many details is a much smaller and more concise set of fundamental principles,DS
 These principles and techniques are applied broadly across functional areas in business,DS
" Probably the broadest business applications are in marketing for tasks such as targeted marketing, online advertising, and recommendations for cross-selling",DS
 Data science also is applied for general customer relationship management to analyze customer behavior in order to manage attrition and maximize expected customer value,DS
 The finance industry uses data science for credit scoring and trading and in operations via fraud detection and workforce management,DS
" Major retailers from Wal-Mart to Amazon apply data science throughout their businesses, from marketing to supply-chain management",DS
" Many firms have differentiated themselves strategically with data science, sometimes to the point of evolving into data-mining companies",DS
 But data science involves much more than just data-mining algorithms,DS
 Successful data scientists must be able to view business problems from a data perspective,DS
" There is a fundamental structure to data-analytic thinking, and basic principles that should be understood",DS
 Data science draws from many â€کâ€کtraditionalâ€™â€™ fields of study,DS
 Fundamental principles of causal analysis must be understood,DS
 A large portion of what has traditionally been studied within the field of statistics is fundamental to data science,DS
 Methods and methology for visualizing data are vital,DS
" There are also particular areas where intuition, creativity, common sense, and knowledge of a particular application must be brought to bear",DS
" A data-science perspective provides practitioners with structure and principles, which give the data scientist a framework to systematically treat problems of extracting useful knowledge from data",DS
" Data Science in Action For concreteness, letâ€™s look at two brief case studies of analyzing data to extract predictive patterns",DS
 These studies illustrate different sorts of applications of data science,DS
" The first was reported in the New York Times: Hurricane Frances was on its way, barreling across the Caribbean, threatening a direct hit on Floridaâ€™s Atlantic coast",DS
" Residents made for higher ground, but far away, in Bentonville, Ark",DS
", executives at WalMart Stores decided that the situation offered a great opportunity for one of their newest data-driven weapons",DS
predictive technology,DS
" A week ahead of the stormâ€™s landfall, Linda M",DS
" Dillman, Wal-Martâ€™s chief information officer, pressed her staff to come up with forecasts based on what had happened when Hurricane Charley struck several weeks earlier",DS
" Backed by the trillions of bytesâ€™ worth of shopper history that is stored in WalMartâ€™s data warehouse, she felt that the company could â€کâ€کstart predicting whatâ€™s going to happen, instead of waiting for it to happen,â€™â€™ as she put it",DS
 It would be more valuable to discover patterns due to the hurricane that were not obvious,DS
" To do this, analysts might examine the huge volume of Wal-Mart data from prior, similar situations (such as Hurricane Charley earlier in the same season) to identify unusual local demand for products",DS
" From such patterns, the company might be able to anticipate unusual demand for products and rush stock to the stores ahead of the hurricaneâ€™s landfall",DS
" Indeed, that is what happened",DS
 The New York Times reported that: â€کâ€ک,DS
 the experts mined the data and found that the stores would indeed need certain productsâ€”and not just the usual flashlights,DS
" â€کWe didnâ€™t know in the past that strawberry Pop-Tarts increase in sales, like seven times their normal sales rate, ahead of a hurricane,â€™ Ms",DS
 Dillman said in a recent interview,DS
â€™ And the pre-hurricane top-selling item was beer,DS
" Despite the impression one might get from the media, there is a lot to data processing that is not data science",DS
" Data engineering and processing are critical to support data-science activities, as shown in Figure 1, but they are more general and are useful for much more",DS
" Data-processing technologies are important for many business tasks that do not involve extracting knowledge or data-driven decision making, such as efficient transaction processing, modern web system processing, online advertising campaign management, and others",DS
" â€کâ€کBig dataâ€™â€™ technologies, such as Hadoop, Hbase, CouchDB, and others have received considerable media attention recently",DS
" For this article, we will simply take big data to mean datasets that are too large for traditional data-processing systems and that therefore require new technologies",DS
" As with the traditional technologies, big data technologies are used for many tasks, including data engineering",DS
" Occasionally, big data technologies are actually used for implementing datamining techniques, but more often the well-known big data technologies are used for data processing in support of the data-mining techniques and other data-science activities, as represented in Figure 1",DS
 Economist Prasanna Tambe of New York Universityâ€™s Stern School has examined the extent to which the utilization of big data technologies seems to help firms,DS
"4 He finds that, after controlling for various possible confounding factors, the use of big data technologies correlates with significant additional productivity growth",DS
" Specifically, one standard deviation higher utilization of big data technologies is associated with 1â€“3% higher productivity than the average firm; one standard deviation lower in terms of big data utilization is associated with 1â€“3% lower productivity",DS
 This leads to potentially very large productivity differences between the firms at the extremes,DS
 One way to think about the state of big data technologies is to draw an analogy with the business adoption of internet technologies,DS
 In Web 1,DS
"0, businesses busied themselves with getting the basic internet technologies in place so that they could establish a web presence, build electronic commerce capability, and improve operating efficiency",DS
 We can think of ourselves as being in the era of Big Data 1,DS
"0, with firms engaged in building capabilities to process large data",DS
" These primarily support their current operationsâ€”for example, to make themselves more efficient",DS
 With Web 1,DS
"0, once firms had incorporated basic technologies thoroughly (and in the process had driven down prices) they started to look further",DS
" They began to ask what the web could do for them, and how it could improve upon what theyâ€™d always done",DS
 This ushered in the era of Web 2,DS
"0, in which new systems and companies started to exploit the interactive nature of the web",DS
 The changes brought on by this shift in thinking are extensive and pervasive; the most obvious are the incorporation of socialnetworking components and the rise of the â€کâ€کvoiceâ€™â€™ of the individual consumer (and citizen),DS
" Similarly, we should expect a Big Data 2",DS
0 phase to follow Big Data 1,DS
" Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: What can I now do that I couldnâ€™t do before, or do better than I could do before? This is likely to usher in the golden era of data science",DS
 The principles and techniques of data science will be applied far more broadly and far more deeply than they are today,DS
 It is important to note that in the Web-1,DS
"0 era, some precocious companies began applying Web-2",DS
0 ideas far ahead of the mainstream,DS
" Amazon is a prime example, incorporating the consumerâ€™s â€کâ€کvoiceâ€™â€™ early on in the rating of products and product reviews (and deeper, in the rating of reviewers)",DS
" Similarly, we see some companies already applying Big Data 2",DS
0,DS
" Amazon again is a company at the forefront, providing data-driven recommendations from massive data",DS
 There are other examples as well,DS
 Online advertisers must process extremely large volumes of data (billions of ad impressions per day is not unusual) and maintain a very high throughput (real-time bidding systems make decisions in tens of milliseconds),DS
 We should look to these and similar industries for signs of advances in big data and data science that subsequently will be adopted by other industries,DS
 Data-Analytic Thinking One of the most critical aspects of data science is the support of data-analytic thinking,DS
 Skill at thinking data-analytically is important not just for the data scientist but throughout the organization,DS
" For example, managers and line employees in other functional areas will only get the best from the companyâ€™s data-science resources if they have some basic understanding of the fundamental principles",DS
 Managers in enterprises without substantial data-science resources should still understand basic principles in order to engage consultants on an informed basis,DS
 Investors in data-science ventures need to understand the fundamental principles in order to assess investment opportunities accurately,DS
" More generally, businesses increasingly are driven by data analytics, and there is great professional advantage in being able to interact competently with and within such businesses",DS
" Understanding the fundamental concepts, and having frameworks for organizing data-analytic thinking, not only will allow one to interact competently, but will help to envision opportunities for improving data-driven decision making or to see data-oriented competitive threats",DS
 Firms in many traditional industries are exploiting new and existing data resources for competitive advantage,DS
 They employ data-science teams to bring advanced technologies to bear to increase revenue and to decrease costs,DS
" In addition, many new companies are being developed with data mining as a key strategic component",DS
" Facebook and Twitter, along with many other â€کâ€کDigital 100â€™â€™ companies,5 have high valuations due primarily to data assets they are committed to capturing or creating",DS
"{ Increasingly, managers need to manage data-analytics teams and data-analysis projects, marketers have to organize and understand data-driven campaigns, venture capitalists must be able to invest wisely in businesses with substantial data assets, and business strategists must be able to devise plans that exploit data",DS
" As a few examples, if a consultant presents a proposal to exploit a data asset to improve your business, you should be able to assess whether the proposal makes sense",DS
" If a competitor announces a new data partnership, you should recognize when it may put you at a strategic disadvantage",DS
" Or, letâ€™s say you take a position with a venture firm and your first project is to assess the potential for investing in an advertising company",DS
" The founders present a convincing argument that they will realize significant value from a unique body of data they will collect, and on that basis",DS
" There is a set of well-studied, fundamental concepts underlying the principled extraction of knowledge from data, with both theoretical and empirical backing",DS
 These fundamental concepts of data science are drawn from many fields that study data analytics,DS
 Some reflect the relationship between data science and the business problems to be solved,DS
 Some reflect the sorts of knowledge discoveries that can be made and are the basis for technical solutions,DS
 Others are cautionary and prescriptive,DS
 We briefly discuss a few here,DS
 This list is not intended to be exhaustive; detailed discussions even of the handful below would fill a book,DS
* The important thing is that we understand these fundamental concepts,DS
 Fundamental concept: Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems can be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages,DS
 The CrossIndustry Standard Process for Data Mining7 (CRISP-DM) is one codification of this process,DS
 Keeping such a process in mind can structure our thinking about data analytics problems,DS
" For example, in actual practice one repeatedly sees analytical â€کâ€کsolutionsâ€™â€™ that are not based on careful analysis of the problem or are not carefully evaluated",DS
 Structured thinking about analytics emphasizes these often underappreciated aspects of supporting decision making with data,DS
 Such structured thinking also contrasts critical points at which human intuition and creativity is necessary versus points at which high-powered analytical tools can be brought to bear,DS
 Fundamental concept: Evaluating data-science results requires careful consideration of the context in which they will be used,DS
 Whether knowledge extracted from data will aid in decision making depends critically on the application in question,DS
" For our churn-management example, how exactly are we going to use the patterns that are extracted from historical data? More generally, does the pattern lead to better decisions than some reasonable alternative? How well would one have done by chance? How well would one do with a smart â€کâ€کdefaultâ€™â€™ alternative? Many data science evaluation frameworks are based on this fundamental concept",DS
 Fundamental concept: The relationship between the business problem and the analytics solution often can be decomposed into tractable subproblems via the framework of analyzing expected value,DS
" Various tools for mining data exist, but business problems rarely come neatly prepared for their application",DS
" Breaking the business problem up into components corresponding to estimating probabilities and computing or estimating values, along with a structure for recombining the components, is broadly useful",DS
 We have many specific tools for estimating probabilities and values from data,DS
" For our churn example, should the value of the customer be taken into account in addition to the likelihood of leaving? It is difficult to realistically assess any customer-targeting solution without phrasing the problem as one of expected value",DS
 Fundamental concept: Information technology can be used to find informative data items from within a large body of data,DS
 One of the first data-science concepts encountered in business-analytics scenarios is the notion of finding correlations,DS
" â€کâ€کCorrelationâ€™â€™ often is used loosely to mean data items that provide information about other data itemsâ€”specifically, known quantities that reduce our uncertainty about unknown quantities",DS
" In our churn example, a quantity of interest is the likelihood that a particular customer will leave after her contract expires",DS
" Before the contract expires, this would be an unknown quantity",DS
" However, there may be known data items (usage, service history",DS
 Data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems â€“ and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved,DS
"Theyâ€™re part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter",DS
" And, because they straddle both the business and IT worlds, theyâ€™re highly sought-after and well-paid",DS
 Who wouldnâ€™t want to be one?,DS
Theyâ€™re also a sign of the times,DS
" Data scientists werenâ€™t on many radars a decade ago, but their sudden popularity reflects how businesses now think about big data",DS
 That unwieldy mass of unstructured information can no longer be ignored and forgotten,DS
 Itâ€™s a virtual gold mine that helps boost revenue â€“ as long as thereâ€™s someone who digs in and unearths business insights that no one thought to look for before,DS
 Enter the data scientist,DS
Where did they come from?,DS
Many data scientists began their careers as statisticians or data analysts,DS
" But as big data (and big data storage and processing technologies such as Hadoop) began to grow and evolve, those roles evolved as well",DS
 Data is no longer just an afterthought for IT to handle,DS
" Itâ€™s key information that requires analysis, creative curiosity and a knack for translating high-tech ideas into new ways to turn a profit",DS
The data scientist role also has academic origins,DS
" A few years ago, universities began to recognize that employers wanted people who were programmers and team players",DS
" Professors tweaked their classes to accommodate this â€“ and some programs, such as the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University, prepared to churn out the next generation of data scientists",DS
 There are now more than 60 similar programs in universities around the countr,DS
 Most of the organizations have on their hands mountains of data that they could use in making decisions,DS
" The possibilities are infinite when answering business questions by companyâ€™s using data accumulated in Data Warehouse and, in the same manner, in data base unstructured or text format generated by Social Media",DS
 The answers are hard to find,DS
" Big Data concept is percept by many as to be referring to data received from structured and unstructured data coming from the classic and new type sources, like social media, but all related to human activity [1]",DS
 Lately the data generated by sensors (M2M phenomenon) began to generate the largest volumes of information that need to be analyzed and read,DS
" Todays tot analyests are more wizerds than giving simple reports, because they also use creativity skills and insight informations for strategic analysis",DS
 Data wizerds are using their ability in the activity including personal knowlage given by the experience with analytic procces and associated applications,DS
" They not only understend the given tasks but also the needs of the companies manangement department, but also have the klowleage where to find those informations suiteble for taking strategical decisions",DS
" With all this, most of the caseses of data wizers positions are filled by people not qualified for extracting data for analysis or doing consolidation data structures at company level",DS
 In this domain the applications are helping improve the profesional level,DS
 This paper wants to address this aspect of the necesar transformation of the Big Data analyst wizer into a specials in the domain of large volumes informations analysis,DS
 The discussions aroundخ‌theخ‌notionخ‌â€œBig Dataâ€‌خ‌ most of the times start from false premisesâ€™,DS
" Most of the discussions are regarding on technological platforms of processing Big Data concentrated on volume, variety, speed and leaving aside any reference of value",DS
" In order to obtain value from Big Data is required to add contextual information, which can be obtain just through placing analytic capabilities in the hands of the ones that need to extract the value",DS
" In other words, Big Data isخ‌inخ‌needخ‌ofخ‌â€کhumanizationâ€™",DS
" To humanize means to transform something inaccessible in something usable, making difficult â€“ easy, from complex â€“ simple, from abstract â€“ concretely",DS
 Meaning the process of puttingخ‌ theخ‌ informationخ‌ intoخ‌ contextخ‌ toخ‌ â€کtell the storyâ€™خ‌ aboutخ‌ whom and what generates that information,DS
" Bigخ‌Dataخ‌mustخ‌ beخ‌extractخ‌ fromخ‌theخ‌ â€کbitsâ€™خ‌ andخ‌ â€کbytesâ€™خ‌ worldخ‌ inخ‌ whichخ‌ areخ‌ availableخ‌ justخ‌ forخ‌ experts and made accessible, useful and capableخ‌toخ‌â€کtell the storyâ€™;خ‌justخ‌inخ‌thisخ‌mannerخ‌ they must be converted into real insight for real business people",DS
"خ‌Bigخ‌Dataخ‌mustخ‌beخ‌â€کdown to earthâ€™, right there the people that know the business can use that information to make decisions, revealing in this way their real value",DS
 Big Data humanization depends on two critical elements,DS
 Data easy access,DS
"the ability to access, integrate, analyze Big Data should be available for data and business analysts involved in making strategic decisions in the organization",DS
" Access to suitable instruments able to give context, that helps Big Data to â€کtell the storyâ€™: Big Data could offer a convertible business image only if is linked by the full context offered by all available data and if can be run sophisticated analysis without the need of advance data science and statistic knowledge",DS
 Working current flux of Big Data uses to many resources and humans to generate value,DS
 With most BI tools (Business Intelligence) existing create reports and analysis only based on previous structured data,DS
" These are, usually, only internal data, without inside data from the market, competitive intelligence and geographic data",DS
" Because of this, the results tell only one side to the story",DS
 Working current fluxes of Big Data have several components,DS
 The data must be acquired from countless sources and clean up,DS
" Then, the data mast be sorted and linked in such a way that allows interrogationsâ€™",DS
 After words must be stored in the system as file types that accepts unstructured formats,DS
" The analysts and software developers have after to work together in statistics environments like R, SAS and SPSS to interrogate the data [2]",DS
" In the end, the result data can be visualize in several forms â€“ as statistic report or, sometimes, as 2D or 3D visualizations",DS
" As result, working Big Data fluxes â€“ as available today â€“ are looking more as jumps than as fluent fluxes",DS
 The problem is created by the situation that all this work is not lead by a business user working in team with data analysts,DS
" Executed mostly by a team of IT specialists from â€کbehind the sceneâ€™ and each step of the process requires the involvement of someone else which has, usually, substantial setbacks with other projects",DS
" Big Data working fluxes involves a finite number of changes and reruns, resulting in delays due to huge requests from the advance analytical abilities persona",DS
" The person closes to the business user, the dataخ‌ orخ‌ businessخ‌ analyst,خ‌ canâ€™tخ‌ perform by himself a large part of the work and in this way time that runs between interrogations and insight informationâ€™s records significant delays",DS
" In fact, most of the times, decisions are taken based on limited informationâ€™s, before the results from working Big Data flux came back",DS
" Because of it, fast and independent access of data analysts and capabilities given and powerful tools, are the core of the humanization of data",DS
" Following will discuss about the emancipation of the analyst role existing in company by upgrading them to wizard rank, capable to extract important insight, backing up the decisional factors with informationâ€™s that help taking fast and fully informed decisions",DS
" Big Data humanization makes that â€™large volumes of dataâ€™ to become accesible for analysts in the companies, offering the abilities availables, most of the time, only for IT (Information Technology) department",DS
" Makig possible presenting the data as informations, easy accessible and related to the subjects",DS
 Is about an analysis based on Big Data effortless and in a natural manner,DS
" In order not to focus strictly on software development and statistic abilities, data obtained can be humanize by adding right context and by offering simple and direct tools for building analitic applications",DS
" Big Data humanization means direct work with data, in such a way that they cand tell their story",DS
" The complete image leads, in this way, to insight business",DS
" Meaning, also, a new oportunity for data analysts to perfect their art and to extend the capacity of independent way of analysis",DS
" They become, from data wizers specialists in data analysis",DS

" In the past, data analysts requared advance knowleage of statistics and business",DS
" In this moment, being able to access to analytic and contextual data tools, which usually were accessible only to data experts and IT, the analysts can become masters of data",DS
" A wizerd is a person that takes raw materials (data in our case) and uses their skill, knowledge and vision to create something of unique value",DS
" Data wizerds have a superior understanding not only over the data they observe, but also also the business and its problems",DS
" Because the data wizers understand data and business so well that they can provide the right tools to use, obtaining in this way the most suitable results and ways to aply , several times, for business problems",DS
 Work of data wizerds is the essence of Big Data humanization,DS
 Data wizerds are â€کhumanization mastersâ€™خ‌ when talking about Big Data,DS
" They create data and analytic working fluxs that revel the true story, regardless if they deliver an answer to a specific questions or a new application for business users at the end of the process",DS
 Is considered by the data analysts that the given data by the automatic sensors will generate the next wave of growing in production and technological innovation,DS
" Statistic reports show, for example, that being engines witch are working on the planes in use worldwide have reached the point of generatingخ‌ 10خ‌ TBخ‌ ofخ‌ dataخ‌ andخ‌ informationâ€™sخ‌ for every half of hour of functioning",DS
 A line plane with four engines can generate 640 TB of data for one flight across Atlantic,DS
 If the number is multiplied by over 25,DS
"000 flights every day, the obtained volume of data is overwhelming",DS
" Until now, almost all this data was lost at the end of the flight, but things are going to change",DS
" Why? Thanks to the tools and technology of Big Data, now ca identify, store, redraw and analyze the data in an efficient manner regarding costs and time use",DS
" This will provide huge opportunities, for example in the area on maintenance and defects prevision for planes â€“ with direct effects in reducing the flights delays and cancelation reasons due to technical defects on planes",DS
 The example given above is not unique,DS
" The practice case of the data obtained by sensors can be now efficiently analysis, in real time, in several activity areas",DS
" For example, intelligent sensors used in electric networks can generate large volumes of data which can be used to increase productivity",DS
" As agriculture and agricol industry is considered one of the strategic engines of operating the romanian economy in the future, one case study has showed that using Big Data in an agricol area in USA might raise the interest to use such solutions to increase efficiency of production also in Romania",DS
" Concret, is about a project taking place in Flint Valley River, a land specific for agriculture from south-west of Georgia",DS
" At the finish of this project, the landlords from the are will receive extrem precice forecast, each one for his specific farm from three days ahead",DS
" Around this time, a team of resurcers from Flint River Soil and Water Conservation District, American Agricultural Department, Georgia University and IBM are using Big Data sophisticated tools to analyze big volumes of forecast weather data, geografic, historical and of other nature",DS
 The purpose is to pathern the forcast phenomenons to a very precise manner then the ones we already have available today,DS
" This kinds of forecasts will help the farmers to make smart decisions related to watering solutions, sowing, harvest and soil fertilization, that will permit them to better use the water supply and increase the volume of the harvest",DS
 Flint River Valley represents an important part of Agricola industry in the state of Georgia,DS
 The farms from this region of 27 districts represent an annual income of around 2 billions dollars at the revenues of United States,DS
" With approximately ten years back, the authority of water conservation from this region signed a partnership with American Agriculture Department, University of Georgia and other local, regional and state agencies to promote the practices of conservation the use water between farmers of the area",DS
 The effort done in the meantime has already started to provide important results,DS
 One so called VRI technology (Variable Rate Irrigation) developed by resources from Georgiaâ€™sخ‌Universityخ‌hasخ‌passedخ‌fastخ‌fromخ‌theخ‌ concept state to a commercial product,DS
" Based on GPS, this technology allows farmers to arrange the water sprinklers, in such a way that the water will be use efficient only in the needed areas by redirecting the jets",DS
 The project linked to Big Data using for efficient forecast pattern is the second big project developed by the entities named above and has no release date yet,DS
 The outcome at the end of this project will generate improved forecasts and also mobility by using intelligent devices like pads and smart phones,DS
" Regardless the general positive phenomenon over the efficiency of forensic data analysis, the study shows that the majority of companies are not working with big enough data in comparison with the corporative income",DS
 Only 18% of intern audit specialists interviewed are working with large volumes over a million records,DS
" Between them, the ones in financial business, only 21% have declaimed to work with large volumes of data of approximately or over milion recordings, a low percent for a concentration segment of data",DS
" Per assemble, 71% of the companies with revenues over 1 billion USD are working with sets of data under 1 million recordings",DS
" The usage of smaller volumes of data than expected, in comparison with the companies revenues, are an indication that many companies can miss important opportunity to prevent and identify defraud just because they are not working with large volumes of data",DS
" Forensic data analysis advance tools, like statistic analysis and mining data technologies, are used only by 10% of the ones questioned",DS
" Is not, as result, a big surprise the fact that the bigger challenge mentioned regarding forensic data analysis is ""obtaining the necessary expertise or the suitable tools """,DS
" From the study, as conclusion, that the support of the efforts of using forensic data analysis inside the company seems like a key task",DS
" So, 62% of the questions ones have stated that is necessary to improve awareness in management team over the benefits given by forensic data analysis",DS
" Interesting is the fact that the one responsible are not considering the costs as a major obstacle, Most of the organizations have on their hands mountains of data that they could use in making decisions",DS
" The possibilities are infinite when answering business questions by companyâ€™s using data accumulated in Data Warehouse and, in the same manner, in data base unstructured or text format generated by Social Media",DS

" A wizerd is a person that takes raw materials (data in our case) and uses their skill, knowledge and vision to create something of unique value",DS
" Data wizerds have a superior understanding not only over the data they observe, but also also the business and its problems",DS
" Because the data wizers understand data and business so well that they can provide the right tools to use, obtaining in this way the most suitable results and ways to aply , several times, for business problems",DS
 Work of data wizerds is the essence of Big Data humanization,DS
 Data wizerds are â€کhumanization mastersâ€™خ‌ when talking about Big Data,DS
" They create data and analytic working fluxs that revel the true story, regardless if they deliver an answer to a specific questions or a new application for business users at the end of the process",DS
 Is considered by the data analysts that the given data by the automatic sensors will generate the next wave of growing in production and technological innovation,DS
" Statistic reports show, for example, that being engines witch are working on the planes in use worldwide have reached the point of generatingخ‌ 10خ‌ TBخ‌ ofخ‌ dataخ‌ andخ‌ informationâ€™sخ‌ for every half of hour of functioning",DS
 A line plane with four engines can generate 640 TB of data for one flight across Atlantic,DS
 If the number is multiplied by over 25,DS
"000 flights every day, the obtained volume of data is overwhelming",DS
" Until now, almost all this data was lost at the end of the flight, but things are going to change",DS
" Why? Thanks to the tools and technology of Big Data, now ca identify, store, redraw and analyze the data in an efficient manner regarding costs and time use",DS
" This will provide huge opportunities, for example in the area on maintenance and defects prevision for planes â€“ with direct effects in reducing the flights delays and cancelation reasons due to technical defects on planes",DS
 The example given above is not unique,DS
" The practice case of the data obtained by sensors can be now efficiently analysis, in real time, in several activity areas",DS
" For example, intelligent sensors used in electric networks can generate large volumes of data which can be used to increase productivity",DS
" As agriculture and agricol industry is considered one of the strategic engines of operating the romanian economy in the future, one case study has showed that using Big Data in an agricol area in USA might raise the interest to use such solutions to increase efficiency of production also in Romania",DS
" Concret, is about a project taking place in Flint Valley River, a land specific for agriculture from south-west of Georgia",DS
" At the finish of this project, the landlords from the are will receive extrem precice forecast, each one for his specific farm from three days ahead",DS
" Around this time, a team of resurcers from Flint River Soil and Water Conservation District, American Agricultural Department, Georgia University and IBM are using Big Data sophisticated tools to analyze big volumes of forecast weather data, geografic, historical and of other nature",DS
 The purpose is to pathern the forcast phenomenons to a very precise manner then the ones we already have available today,DS
" This kinds of forecasts will help the farmers to make smart decisions related to watering solutions, sowing, harvest and soil fertilization, that will permit them to better use the water supply and increase the volume of the harvest",DS
 Flint River Valley represents an important part of Agricola industry in the state of Georgia,DS
 The farms from this region of 27 districts represent an annual income of around 2 billions dollars at the revenues of United States,DS
" With approximately ten years back, the authority of water conservation from this region signed a partnership with American Agriculture Department, University of Georgia and other local, regional and state agencies to promote the practices of conservation the use water between farmers of the area",DS
 The effort done in the meantime has already started to provide important results,DS
 One so called VRI technology (Variable Rate Irrigation) developed by resources from Georgiaâ€™sخ‌Universityخ‌hasخ‌passedخ‌fastخ‌fromخ‌theخ‌ concept state to a commercial product,DS
" Based on GPS, this technology allows farmers to arrange the water sprinklers, in such a way that the water will be use efficient only in the needed areas by redirecting the jets",DS
 The project linked to Big Data using for efficient forecast pattern is the second big project developed by the entities named above and has no release date yet,DS
 The outcome at the end of this project will generate improved forecasts and also mobility by using intelligent devices like pads and smart phones,DS
" Regardless the general positive phenomenon over the efficiency of forensic data analysis, the study shows that the majority of companies are not working with big enough data in comparison with the corporative income",DS
 Only 18% of intern audit specialists interviewed are working with large volumes over a million records,DS
" Between them, the ones in financial business, only 21% have declaimed to work with large volumes of data of approximately or over milion recordings, a low percent for a concentration segment of data",DS
" Per assemble, 71% of the companies with revenues over 1 billion USD are working with sets of data under 1 million recordings",DS
" The usage of smaller volumes of data than expected, in comparison with the companies revenues, are an indication that many companies can miss important opportunity to prevent and identify defraud just because they are not working with large volumes of data",DS
" Forensic data analysis advance tools, like statistic analysis and mining data technologies, are used only by 10% of the ones questioned",DS
" Is not, as result, a big surprise the fact that the bigger challenge mentioned regarding forensic data analysis is ""obtaining the necessary expertise or the suitable tools """,DS
" From the study, as conclusion, that the support of the efforts of using forensic data analysis inside the company seems like a key task",DS
" So, 62% of the questions ones have stated that is necessary to improve awareness in management team over the benefits given by forensic data analysis",DS
" Interesting is the fact that the one responsible are not considering the costs as a major obstacle,",DS
Business intelligence systems combine operational data with analytical tools to present complex and competitive information to planners and decision makers,DS
 The objective is to improve the timeliness and quality of inputs to the decision process,DS
" Business Intelligence is used to understand the capabilities available in the firm; the state of the art, trends, and future directions in the markets, the technologies, and the regulatory environment in which the firm competes; and the actions of competitors and the implications of these actions",DS
" The emergence of the data warehouse as a repository, advances in data cleansing, increased capabilities of hardware and software, and the emergence of the web architecture all combine to create a richer business intelligence environment than was available previously",DS
" Although business intelligence systems are widely used in industry, research about them is limited",DS
" This paper, in addition to being a tutorial, proposes a BI framework and potential research topics",DS
" The framework highlights the importance of unstructured data and discusses the need to develop BI tools for its acquisition, integration, cleanup, search, analysis, and delivery",DS
" In addition, this paper explores a matrix for BI data types (structured vs",DS
 unstructured) and data sources (internal and external) to guide research,DS
" Demand for Business Intelligence (BI) applications continues to grow even at a time when demand for most information technology (IT) products is soft [Soejarto, 2003; Whiting, 2003]",DS
" Yet, information systems (IS) research in this field is, to put it charitably, sparse",DS
" While the term Business Intelligence is relatively new, computer-based business intelligence systems appeared, in one guise or other, close to forty years ago",DS
"1 BI as a term replaced decision support, executive information systems, and management information systems [Thomsen, 2003]",DS
" With each new iteration, capabilities increased as enterprises grew ever-more sophisticated in their computational and analytical needs and as computer hardware and software matured",DS
 In this paper BI systems ,DS
" BI systems combine data gathering, data storage, and knowledge management with analytical tools to present complex internal and competitive information to planners and decision makers",DS
" Implicit in this definition is the idea (perhaps the ideal) that business intelligence systems provide actionable information delivered at the right time, at the right location, and in the right form to assist decision makers",DS
" The objective is to improve the timeliness and quality of inputs to the decision process, hence facilitating managerial work",DS
" Sometimes business intelligence refers to on-line decision making, that is, instant response",DS
" Most of the time, it refers to shrinking the time frame so that the intelligence is still useful to the decision maker when the decision time comes",DS
" In all cases, use of business intelligence is viewed as being proactive",DS
" One implication of this ranking is that merely reporting the performance of a firm and its competitors, which is the strength of many existing software packages, is not enough",DS
 A second implication is that too many firms still view business intelligence (like DSS and EIS before it) as an inward looking function,DS
 Business intelligence is a natural outgrowth of a series of previous systems designed to support decision making,DS
" The emergence of the data warehouse as a repository, the advances in data cleansing that lead to a single truth, the greater capabilities of hardware and software, and the boom of Internet technologies that provided the prevalent user interface all combine to create a richer business intelligence environment than was available previously",DS
 BI pulls information from many other systems,DS
 The transition between structured and semi-structured data types and between internal and external data sources is not defined sharply,DS
" For example, semi-structured data from e-mail and Web sites deal with both internal and external data sourcesâ€” intranets and extranets for Web sites",DS
" Nevertheless, this matrix is useful to guide research and to view the available analytic tools for BI",DS
" For example, ERP systems capture operational (internal) data in a structured format, whereas, CRM focuses on customer (external) information",DS
" On the other hand, semi-structured data is captured in business processes and news items, among other documents",DS
" For the purpose of this paper, business processes and news items are used to represent internal and external data sources, respectively",DS
" Established analytic practice for BI typically involves a solitary user exploring data in what is usually a one-off experience [Russom, 2003]",DS
" Specialists performing analyses in a staff position for senior management can, and often do, create a sub-optimized BI solution",DS
" Because decisions are made at many organizational levels, not just the executive level, a new class of analytic tools is emerging that serves a much broader population within the firm",DS
 These new tools are referred to as â€œBI for the massesâ€‌,DS
 BI for the masses is about providing reporting and analysis capability at all levels of the organization,DS
" For example, firms are rolling out tools such as data mining designed for use by non-specialists [McNight 2003]",DS
 The size of the business intelligence market can be seen from the published forecasts,DS
" For example, AMR research estimates the current BI market at $6 billion with projection to reach $12 billion by 2006 [Darrow, 2003]",DS
" Customers are asking their BI vendors for â€œthe ability to support improved operational decision making â€“ not just deliver analytic and reporting bells and whistlesâ€‌ [Kestelyn, 2003]",DS
" The business of analytic vendors is to get customers out of the business of searching for data and move them into doing more analysis [Blumberg and Atre, 2003a]",DS
" The traditional custom design, build, and integrate model for BI systems is lengthy (at least six months) and costly ($2-3 million) [Rudin and Cressy, 2003]",DS
" Therefore, many firms opt for prebuilt analytic applications to achieve lower total cost of ownership, quicker implementation, rapid return on investment, while still obtaining underlying structure for performance, scalability, and flexibility [Rudin and Cressy, 2003]",DS
" Gartner research found the number of firms that plan to manage their BI integration internally dropping from 49% in 2001 to 37% in 2002 [Soejarto, 2003]",DS
 A study by IDC on OLAP investment over 5-years indicated a $2,DS
"1 million investment in building OLAP solutions in-house resulted in 104% ROI [Morris, 2003]",DS
 The same study indicated a $1,DS
"8 million investment in buying pre-built OLAP solutions resulted in 140% ROI, implying that BI solutions cost less and bring higher ROI [Morris, 2003]",DS
" Intelligent Enterpriseâ€™s study for the 2003 editorâ€™s choice award for BI identified 12 firms to watch in 2003 including Adaytum, Brio Software, Cognos, Crystal Decisions, E",DS
"Intelligence, Fair Issac & Co",DS
", Hyperion Solutions, Information Builders, MicroStrategy, ProClarity, Siebel Systems, and Spotfire [Kestelyn, 2003]",DS
" The study also named 12 vendors as most influential in the overall category including Teradata, SAS, IBM, OutlookSoft, Business Objects, Microsoft, Manhattan Associates, PeopleSoft, Oracle, Ilog, Insight Software, and Open Source/Linux [Stodder, 2003]",DS
 The term Business Intelligence may turn out to be a fad,DS
" However, the underlying concepts, using information technology to deliver actionable information for decision makers, are essential for managing todayâ€™s global businesses",DS
 BI uses both structured and semi-structured data,DS
 The former is much easier to search but the latter contains the information needed for analysis and decision making,DS
" For structured data, many BI tools exist for acquisition, integration, cleanup, search, analysis, and delivery",DS
" Further work is needed, however, to integrate these tools and to provide actionable information",DS
" BI tools for semi-structured data, on the other hand, are not yet mature",DS
" However, significant work is being done in industry to deal with semi-structured data (Kontzer, 2004; MacIntyer, 2004)",DS
 Current trends and topics about unstructured information management can be found at http://www,DS
unstruct,DS
"org, among others",DS
 This paper develops a BI framework and identifies potential research areas,DS
 The BI framework highlights the importance of semi-structured data to support informed action by decision makers,DS
 In addition this paper explored a matrix for BI data types (structured vs,DS
 semi-structured) and data sources (internal vs,DS
 external) to guide research,DS
 The development of analytical tools to integrate structured and semi-structured data can benefit from attention by researchers,DS
" The BI market is growing, and the proportion of semi-structured data used in daily decisions is growing",DS
 Exploring the underlying issues and the development of information technology that provide intelligence to business therefore is a fertile area for research,DS
" BI has its roots in the decision-support technologies first developed in the late 1970s, explained Keith Gile, a market analyst with Forrester Research",DS
 Gartner coined and popularized the term â€œbusiness intelligenceâ€‌ in 1989,DS
"Traditional BI systems consist of a back-end database, a front-end user interface, software that processes the information to produce the business intelligence itself, and a reporting system",DS
" The software's capabilities include decision support, online analytical processing, statistical analysis, forecasting, and data mining",DS
"A variety of companies-including retailers, telecommunications providers, travel agencies, and manufacturers-use BI for activities such as customer profiling, customer support, market research and segmentation, product profitability, statistical analysis, and inventory and distribution analysis",DS
"The major players in today's industry include BI vendors such as Business Objects, Cognos, Hyperion, and Information Builders as well as major software companies like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP",DS
"BI systems frequently consist of multiple elements that don't integrate well together, including best-of-breed components from different vendors",DS
 And the systems often work with information sources whose data also doesn't integrate well,DS
 The scarcity of widely implemented BI standards exacerbates this problem,DS
"These limitations have caused BI to be slow at gathering and analyzing data, making the technology unsuitable for short-term and day-to-day decision making",DS
"BI products and their interfaces have also been more complex than most applications need and require too much technical sophistication for most employees to set up and use effectively, according to Microsoft's Smith",DS
"â€œMost of the tools have rich functionality that is only appropriate for about 5 percent of a company's employees,â€‌ said Forrester's Gile",DS
" For example, in financial systems, the functions might be too intricate for all but the most proficient financial analysts",DS
Vendors also used to offer BI systems only as stand-alone products that did not always integrate well with other corporate software such as customer-relationship management (CRM) and financial applications,DS
 This denied companies the opportunity to analyze the valuable information in these applications,DS
"Meanwhile, the data marts required to store the amounts of data necessary for BI operations were too expensive for most companies",DS
" For example, a terabyte-sized data mart cost$5 million five years ago, noted Richard Wozniak, IBM's director of BI strategy",DS
"Today, though, Wozniak noted, the use of inexpensive open source softwareâ€”as well as proprietary software and hardware that are less costly than in the past-has reduced data marts' prices",DS
Several forces are driving efforts to deal with traditional BI's short-comings,DS
"For example, making BI accessible to more employees enables a company to spread its benefits to more departments and projects and thus get more use out of the technology investment, noted Michael Corcoran, vice president of strategy at Information Builders",DS
"It also enables employees to perform more effectively, said Gartner's Beyer",DS
Real-Time Analysis,DS
BI systems frequently have been unable to get results to users in a timely manner because of component and data-integration problems,DS
"In large organizations, IT departments have had to gather information from multiple databases-such as those in accounting programs and enterprise-resource-planning applications-and normalize it into a single view in a time-consuming, frequently manual process",DS
"New service-oriented-architecture tools provide interfaces to various data types, which helps integrate data sources so that multiple applications can read them",DS
"iWay Software has developed SOA adapters, interfaces that let multiple programs access numerous data sources",DS
 The adapters enable a Google OneBox search appliance to track in real time data stored in more than 85 types of databases and generated by more than 150 transaction types,DS
"With this in mind, vendors Cognos, Information Builders, and SAS are working with Google to use the Google OneBox with their BI systems",DS
BI's new real-time capabilities can even make it easier for companies to work directly with customers,DS
"A customer might be on the phone or an e-commerce Web site for only a few minutes, which limits the time and amount of information a company has to make sales-related decisions, noted Forrester's Gile",DS
" However, new BI approaches can process the information quickly enough to make such decisions",DS
"For example, Travelocity uses BI to analyze customers' input and make hotel, car rental, and other offers to them when they are on the business' Web site or when they visit again in the future, said Mark Hooper, the company's vice president of product development",DS
BI for the Masses,DS
"Vendors are making BI easier to work with, principally via interface improvements, so that a broad group of employees can use the technology even for smaller projects",DS
"In some cases, vendors are giving the BI systems themselves better interfaces",DS
" In addition, software vendors sometimes incorporate BI tools into applications such as Web browsers and Microsoft Excel because employees already know these interfaces",DS
"Cognos, Information Builders, and SAS are trying to make their BI systems more accessible by integrating them with the Google search bar",DS
Integrating BI with Other Applications,DS
A number of software vendors are developing their own BI capabilities and incorporating them into their corporate applications,DS
 Other vendors are developing ways to integrate other companies' BI systems into their business applications,DS
 These approaches make the data the enterprise applications contain available for analysis and their programs more appealing to customers,DS
"Microsoft plans to include BI capabilities in Office 2007, which customers could access via the software company's PerformancePoint Server 2007, said Smith",DS
"With this approach, Microsoft is trying to offer the entire BI stack: the back-end data mart, data integration tools, front-end BI tools including customized interfaces and hooks into applications such as Excel",DS
IBM's Data Warehouse Edition 9,DS
"1 has added a set of interfaces into its data-management system that make it easier for best-of-breed BI systems to access information stored and managed by IBM data marts, said the company's Wozniak",DS
BI Search,DS
Many large companies have terabytes of data stored in their systems from different applications and data-bases,DS
 The average employee cannot use BI to find useful data in this huge volume of material,DS
" In response, companies are beginning to use metadata to annotate some of the more useful data to make it easier to find",DS
"Improved search coupled with SOA make it easier to use BI with unstructured-data sources, said Information Builders' Corcoran",DS
 SOA parameterizes information so that common data from different formats can be compared,DS
" This approach, featured in products such as Information Builders' WebFOCUS BI system, helps map unstructured information into structured formats",DS
Web-Based BI,DS
Some vendors place a Web-based interface on top of a BI server,DS
 This makes the functionality available to a wide audience via the Internet,DS
The first generation of Web-based BI applications enabled user interaction only via forms and checkboxes,DS
 Newer Web-based systems such as Information Builders' WebFOCUS Active Reports use interactive mini-applications-built with JavaScript and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) techniquesâ€”that allow the kind of point-and-click access and interaction possible via typical application GUIs,DS
IBM includes Alphablox BI software in its Data Warehouse Edition 9,DS
" Alphablox lets users connect online to a database, which they can work with via an active Web page that has a Java-based front end, explained IBM's Wozniak",DS
New Licensing Model,DS
BI systems' cost has dropped because vendors are using a different licensing model than the per-seat approach they used in the past,DS
" Companies used to pay vendors per user, with BI software implemented",DS
"Data science is an essential part of many industries today, given the massive amounts of data that are produced, and is one of the most debated topics in IT circles",DS
" Its popularity has grown over the years, and companies have started implementing data science techniques to grow their business and increase customer satisfaction",DS
" In this article, weâ€™ll learn what data science is, and how you can become a data scientist",DS
 What is Data Science,DS
"Lifecycle, Applications, PrerequisitesPreviousNext",DS
"Now that you know what is data science, next up let us focus on the data science lifecycle",DS
" Data scienceâ€™s lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks:Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction",DS
 This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data,DS
"Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture",DS
 This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used,DS
"Process: Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization",DS
" Data scientists take the prepared data and examine its patterns, ranges, and biases to determine how useful it will be in predictive analysi",DS
"Analyze: Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis",DS
 Here is the real meat of the lifecycle,DS
 This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data,DS
"Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making",DS
" In this final step, analysts prepare the analyses in easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports",DS
Prerequisites for Data Science,DS
Here are some of the technical concepts you should know about before starting to learn what is data science,DS
 Machine learning is the backbone of data science,DS
 Data Scientists need to have a solid grasp of ML in addition to basic knowledge of statistics,DS
 Modeling,DS
Mathematical models enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data,DS
 Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem and how to train these models,DS
 Statistics,DS
Statistics are at the core of data science,DS
 A sturdy handle on statistics can help you extract more intelligence and obtain more meaningful results,DS
Programming,DS
Some level of programming is required to execute a successful data science project,DS
" The most common programming languages are Python, and R",DS
" Python is especially popular because itâ€™s easy to learn, and it supports multiple libraries for data science and ML",DS
 Databases,DS
"A capable data scientist needs to understand how databases work, how to manage them, and how to extract data from them",DS
"What is Data Science: Lifecycle, Applications, Prerequisites and Tools",DS
"Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions",DS
 Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models,DS
The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats,DS
"Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together datascience programs, and publications are touting data science as a hotâ€”even â€کâ€کsexyâ€™â€™â€”career choice",DS
" However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz",DS
" In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science",DS
" One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making",DS
 Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitionerâ€™s field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field,DS
 We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance,DS
" We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science",DS
" Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer",DS
" Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science",DS
" In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts",DS
" We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science",DS
" With vast amounts of data now available, companies in almost every industry are focused on exploiting data for competitive advantage",DS
" The volume and variety of data have far outstripped the capacity of manual analysis, and in some cases have exceeded the capacity of conventional databases",DS
" At the same time, computers have become far more powerful, networking is ubiquitous, and algorithms have been developed that can connect datasets to enable broader and deeper analyses than previously possible",DS
 The convergence of these phenomena has given rise to the increasingly widespread business application of data science,DS
 Companies across industries have realized that they need to hire more data scientists,DS
 Academic institutions are scrambling to put together programs to train data scientists,DS
 Publications are touting data science as a hot career choice and even sexy,DS
" At a high level, data science is a set of fundamental principles that support and guide the principled extraction of information and knowledge from data",DS
 Possibly the most closely related concept to data science is data miningâ€”the actual extraction of knowledge from data via technologies that incorporate these principles,DS
" There are hundreds of different data-mining algorithms, and a great deal of detail to the methods of the field",DS
 We argue that underlying all these many details is a much smaller and more concise set of fundamental principles,DS
 These principles and techniques are applied broadly across functional areas in business,DS
" Probably the broadest business applications are in marketing for tasks such as targeted marketing, online advertising, and recommendations for cross-selling",DS
 Data science also is applied for general customer relationship management to analyze customer behavior in order to manage attrition and maximize expected customer value,DS
 The finance industry uses data science for credit scoring and trading and in operations via fraud detection and workforce management,DS
" Major retailers from Wal-Mart to Amazon apply data science throughout their businesses, from marketing to supply-chain management",DS
" Many firms have differentiated themselves strategically with data science, sometimes to the point of evolving into data-mining companies",DS
 But data science involves much more than just data-mining algorithms,DS
 Successful data scientists must be able to view business problems from a data perspective,DS
" There is a fundamental structure to data-analytic thinking, and basic principles that should be understood",DS
 Data science draws from many â€کâ€کtraditionalâ€™â€™ fields of study,DS
 Fundamental principles of causal analysis must be understood,DS
 A large portion of what has traditionally been studied within the field of statistics is fundamental to data science,DS
 Methods and methology for visualizing data are vital,DS
predictive technology,DS
" A week ahead of the stormâ€™s landfall, Linda M",DS
" Dillman, Wal-Martâ€™s chief information officer, pressed her staff to come up with forecasts based on what had happened when Hurricane Charley struck several weeks earlier",DS
" Backed by the trillions of bytesâ€™ worth of shopper history that is stored in WalMartâ€™s data warehouse, she felt that the company could â€کâ€کstart predicting whatâ€™s going to happen, instead of waiting for it to happen,â€™â€™ as she put it",DS
 It would be more valuable to discover patterns due to the hurricane that were not obvious,DS
" To do this, analysts might examine the huge volume of Wal-Mart data from prior, similar situations (such as Hurricane Charley earlier in the same season) to identify unusual local demand for products",DS
" From such patterns, the company might be able to anticipate unusual demand for products and rush stock to the stores ahead of the hurricaneâ€™s landfall",DS
" Indeed, that is what happened",DS
 The New York Times reported that: â€کâ€ک,DS
 the experts mined the data and found that the stores would indeed need certain productsâ€”and not just the usual flashlights,DS
" â€کWe didnâ€™t know in the past that strawberry Pop-Tarts increase in sales, like seven times their normal sales rate, ahead of a hurricane,â€™ Ms",DS
 Dillman said in a recent interview,DS
â€™ And the pre-hurricane top-selling item was beer,DS
" Despite the impression one might get from the media, there is a lot to data processing that is not data science",DS
" Data engineering and processing are critical to support data-science activities, as shown in Figure 1, but they are more general and are useful for much more",DS
" Data-processing technologies are important for many business tasks that do not involve extracting knowledge or data-driven decision making, such as efficient transaction processing, modern web system processing, online advertising campaign management, and others",DS
" â€کâ€کBig dataâ€™â€™ technologies, such as Hadoop, Hbase, CouchDB, and others have received considerable media attention recently",DS
" For this article, we will simply take big data to mean datasets that are too large for traditional data-processing systems and that therefore require new technologies",DS
" As with the traditional technologies, big data technologies are used for many tasks, including data engineering",DS
" Occasionally, big data technologies are actually used for implementing datamining techniques, but more often the well-known big data technologies are used for data processing in support of the data-mining techniques and other data-science activities, as represented in Figure 1",DS
 Economist Prasanna Tambe of New York Universityâ€™s Stern School has examined the extent to which the utilization of big data technologies seems to help firms,DS
"4 He finds that, after controlling for various possible confounding factors, the use of big data technologies correlates with significant additional productivity growth",DS
" Specifically, one standard deviation higher utilization of big data technologies is associated with 1â€“3% higher productivity than the average firm; one standard deviation lower in terms of big data utilization is associated with 1â€“3% lower productivity",DS
 This leads to potentially very large productivity differences between the firms at the extremes,DS
 One way to think about the state of big data technologies is to draw an analogy with the business adoption of internet technologies,DS
 In Web 1,DS
"0, businesses busied themselves with getting the basic internet technologies in place so that they could establish a web presence, build electronic commerce capability, and improve operating efficiency",DS
 We can think of ourselves as being in the era of Big Data 1,DS
"0, with firms engaged in building capabilities to process large data",DS
" These primarily support their current operationsâ€”for example, to make themselves more efficient",DS
 With Web 1,DS
"0, once firms had incorporated basic technologies thoroughly (and in the process had driven down prices) they started to look further",DS
" They began to ask what the web could do for them, and how it could improve upon what theyâ€™d always done",DS
 This ushered in the era of Web 2,DS
"0, in which new systems and companies started to exploit the interactive nature of the web",DS
 The changes brought on by this shift in thinking are extensive and pervasive; the most obvious are the incorporation of socialnetworking components and the rise of the â€کâ€کvoiceâ€™â€™ of the individual consumer (and citizen),DS
" Similarly, we should expect a Big Data 2",DS
0 phase to follow Big Data 1,DS
" Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: What can I now do that I couldnâ€™t do before, or do better than I could do before? This is likely to usher in the golden era of data science",DS
 The principles and techniques of data science will be applied far more broadly and far more deeply than they are today,DS
 It is important to note that in the Web-1,DS
"0 era, some precocious companies began applying Web-2",DS
0 ideas far ahead of the mainstream,DS
" Amazon is a prime example, incorporating the consumerâ€™s â€کâ€کvoiceâ€™â€™ early on in the rating of products and product reviews (and deeper, in the rating of reviewers)",DS
" Similarly, we see some companies already applying Big Data 2",DS
0,DS
" Amazon again is a company at the forefront, providing data-driven recommendations from massive data",DS
 There are other examples as well,DS
 Online advertisers must process extremely large volumes of data (billions of ad impressions per day is not unusual) and maintain a very high throughput (real-time bidding systems make decisions in tens of milliseconds),DS
 We should look to these and similar industries for signs of advances in big data and data science that subsequently will be adopted by other industries,DS
 Data-Analytic Thinking One of the most critical aspects of data science is the support of data-analytic thinking,DS
 Skill at thinking data-analytically is important not just for the data scientist but throughout the organization,DS
" For example, managers and line employees in other functional areas will only get the best from the companyâ€™s data-science resources if they have some basic understanding of the fundamental principles",DS
 Managers in enterprises without substantial data-science resources should still understand basic principles in order to engage consultants on an informed basis,DS
 Investors in data-science ventures need to understand the fundamental principles in order to assess investment opportunities accurately,DS
" More generally, businesses increasingly are driven by data analytics, and there is great professional advantage in being able to interact competently with and within such businesses",DS
" Understanding the fundamental concepts, and having frameworks for organizing data-analytic thinking, not only will allow one to interact competently, but will help to envision opportunities for improving data-driven decision making or to see data-oriented competitive threats",DS
 Firms in many traditional industries are exploiting new and existing data resources for competitive advantage,DS
 They employ data-science teams to bring advanced technologies to bear to increase revenue and to decrease costs,DS
" In addition, many new companies are being developed with data mining as a key strategic component",DS
" Facebook and Twitter, along with many other â€کâ€کDigital 100â€™â€™ companies,5 have high valuations due primarily to data assets they are committed to capturing or creating",DS
"{ Increasingly, managers need to manage data-analytics teams and data-analysis projects, marketers have to organize and understand data-driven campaigns, venture capitalists must be able to invest wisely in businesses with substantial data assets, and business strategists must be able to devise plans that exploit data",DS
" As a few examples, if a consultant presents a proposal to exploit a data asset to improve your business, you should be able to assess whether the proposal makes sense",DS
" If a competitor announces a new data partnership, you should recognize when it may put you at a strategic disadvantage",DS
" Or, letâ€™s say you take a position with a venture firm and your first project is to assess the potential for investing in an advertising company",DS
" The founders present a convincing argument that they will realize significant value from a unique body of data they will collect, and on that basis",DS
" There is a set of well-studied, fundamental concepts underlying the principled extraction of knowledge from data, with both theoretical and empirical backing",DS
 These fundamental concepts of data science are drawn from many fields that study data analytics,DS
 Some reflect the relationship between data science and the business problems to be solved,DS
 Some reflect the sorts of knowledge discoveries that can be made and are the basis for technical solutions,DS
 Others are cautionary and prescriptive,DS
 We briefly discuss a few here,DS
 This list is not intended to be exhaustive; detailed discussions even of the handful below would fill a book,DS
* The important thing is that we understand these fundamental concepts,DS
 Fundamental concept: Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems can be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages,DS
 The CrossIndustry Standard Process for Data Mining7 (CRISP-DM) is one codification of this process,DS
 Keeping such a process in mind can structure our thinking about data analytics problems,DS
" For example, in actual practice one repeatedly sees analytical â€کâ€کsolutionsâ€™â€™ that are not based on careful analysis of the problem or are not carefully evaluated",DS
 Structured thinking about analytics emphasizes these often underappreciated aspects of supporting decision making with data,DS
 Such structured thinking also contrasts critical points at which human intuition and creativity is necessary versus points at which high-powered analytical tools can be brought to bear,DS
 Fundamental concept: Evaluating data-science results requires careful consideration of the context in which they will be used,DS
 Whether knowledge extracted from data will aid in decision making depends critically on the application in question,DS
" For our churn-management example, how exactly are we going to use the patterns that are extracted from historical data? More generally, does the pattern lead to better decisions than some reasonable alternative? How well would one have done by chance? How well would one do with a smart â€کâ€کdefaultâ€™â€™ alternative? Many data science evaluation frameworks are based on this fundamental concept",DS
 Fundamental concept: The relationship between the business problem and the analytics solution often can be decomposed into tractable subproblems via the framework of analyzing expected value,DS
" Various tools for mining data exist, but business problems rarely come neatly prepared for their application",DS
" Breaking the business problem up into components corresponding to estimating probabilities and computing or estimating values, along with a structure for recombining the components, is broadly useful",DS
 We have many specific tools for estimating probabilities and values from data,DS
" For our churn example, should the value of the customer be taken into account in addition to the likelihood of leaving? It is difficult to realistically assess any customer-targeting solution without phrasing the problem as one of expected value",DS
 Fundamental concept: Information technology can be used to find informative data items from within a large body of data,DS
 One of the first data-science concepts encountered in business-analytics scenarios is the notion of finding correlations,DS
" â€کâ€کCorrelationâ€™â€™ often is used loosely to mean data items that provide information about other data itemsâ€”specifically, known quantities that reduce our uncertainty about unknown quantities",DS
" In our churn example, a quantity of interest is the likelihood that a particular customer will leave after her contract expires",DS
" Before the contract expires, this would be an unknown quantity",DS
" However, there may be known data items (usage, service history",DS
 Data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems â€“ and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved,DS
"Theyâ€™re part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter",DS
" And, because they straddle both the business and IT worlds, theyâ€™re highly sought-after and well-paid",DS
 Who wouldnâ€™t want to be one?,DS
Theyâ€™re also a sign of the times,DS
" Data scientists werenâ€™t on many radars a decade ago, but their sudden popularity reflects how businesses now think about big data",DS
 That unwieldy mass of unstructured information can no longer be ignored and forgotten,DS
 Itâ€™s a virtual gold mine that helps boost revenue â€“ as long as thereâ€™s someone who digs in and unearths business insights that no one thought to look for before,DS
 Enter the data scientist,DS
Where did they come from?,DS
Many data scientists began their careers as statisticians or data analysts,DS
" But as big data (and big data storage and processing technologies such as Hadoop) began to grow and evolve, those roles evolved as well",DS
 Data is no longer just an afterthought for IT to handle,DS
" Itâ€™s key information that requires analysis, creative curiosity and a knack for translating high-tech ideas into new ways to turn a profit",DS
The data scientist role also has academic origins,DS
" A few years ago, universities began to recognize that employers wanted people who were programmers and team players",DS
" Professors tweaked their classes to accommodate this â€“ and some programs, such as the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University, prepared to churn out the next generation of data scientists",DS
 There are now more than 60 similar programs in universities around the countr,DS
 Most of the organizations have on their hands mountains of data that they could use in making decisions,DS
" The possibilities are infinite when answering business questions by companyâ€™s using data accumulated in Data Warehouse and, in the same manner, in data base unstructured or text format generated by Social Media",DS
 The answers are hard to find,DS
" Big Data concept is percept by many as to be referring to data received from structured and unstructured data coming from the classic and new type sources, like social media, but all related to human activity [1]",DS
 Lately the data generated by sensors (M2M phenomenon) began to generate the largest volumes of information that need to be analyzed and read,DS
" Todays tot analyests are more wizerds than giving simple reports, because they also use creativity skills and insight informations for strategic analysis",DS
 Data wizerds are using their ability in the activity including personal knowlage given by the experience with analytic procces and associated applications,DS
" They not only understend the given tasks but also the needs of the companies manangement department, but also have the klowleage where to find those informations suiteble for taking strategical decisions",DS
" With all this, most of the caseses of data wizers positions are filled by people not qualified for extracting data for analysis or doing consolidation data structures at company level",DS
 In this domain the applications are helping improve the profesional level,DS
 This paper wants to address this aspect of the necesar transformation of the Big Data analyst wizer into a specials in the domain of large volumes informations analysis,DS
 The discussions aroundخ‌theخ‌notionخ‌â€œBig Dataâ€‌خ‌ most of the times start from false premisesâ€™,DS
" Most of the discussions are regarding on technological platforms of processing Big Data concentrated on volume, variety, speed and leaving aside any reference of value",DS
" In order to obtain value from Big Data is required to add contextual information, which can be obtain just through placing analytic capabilities in the hands of the ones that need to extract the value",DS
" In other words, Big Data isخ‌inخ‌needخ‌ofخ‌â€کhumanizationâ€™",DS
" To humanize means to transform something inaccessible in something usable, making difficult â€“ easy, from complex â€“ simple, from abstract â€“ concretely",DS
 Meaning the process of puttingخ‌ theخ‌ informationخ‌ intoخ‌ contextخ‌ toخ‌ â€کtell the storyâ€™خ‌ aboutخ‌ whom and what generates that information,DS
" Bigخ‌Dataخ‌mustخ‌ beخ‌extractخ‌ fromخ‌theخ‌ â€کbitsâ€™خ‌ andخ‌ â€کbytesâ€™خ‌ worldخ‌ inخ‌ whichخ‌ areخ‌ availableخ‌ justخ‌ forخ‌ experts and made accessible, useful and capableخ‌toخ‌â€کtell the storyâ€™;خ‌justخ‌inخ‌thisخ‌mannerخ‌ they must be converted into real insight for real business people",DS
"خ‌Bigخ‌Dataخ‌mustخ‌beخ‌â€کdown to earthâ€™, right there the people that know the business can use that information to make decisions, revealing in this way their real value",DS
 Big Data humanization depends on two critical elements,DS
 Data easy access,DS
"the ability to access, integrate, analyze Big Data should be available for data and business analysts involved in making strategic decisions in the organization",DS
" Access to suitable instruments able to give context, that helps Big Data to â€کtell the storyâ€™: Big Data could offer a convertible business image only if is linked by the full context offered by all available data and if can be run sophisticated analysis without the need of advance data science and statistic knowledge",DS
 Working current flux of Big Data uses to many resources and humans to generate value,DS
 With most BI tools (Business Intelligence) existing create reports and analysis only based on previous structured data,DS
" These are, usually, only internal data, without inside data from the market, competitive intelligence and geographic data",DS
" Because of this, the results tell only one side to the story",DS
 Working current fluxes of Big Data have several components,DS
 The data must be acquired from countless sources and clean up,DS
" Then, the data mast be sorted and linked in such a way that allows interrogationsâ€™",DS
 After words must be stored in the system as file types that accepts unstructured formats,DS
" The analysts and software developers have after to work together in statistics environments like R, SAS and SPSS to interrogate the data [2]",DS
" In the end, the result data can be visualize in several forms â€“ as statistic report or, sometimes, as 2D or 3D visualizations",DS
" As result, working Big Data fluxes â€“ as available today â€“ are looking more as jumps than as fluent fluxes",DS
 The problem is created by the situation that all this work is not lead by a business user working in team with data analysts,DS
" Executed mostly by a team of IT specialists from â€کbehind the sceneâ€™ and each step of the process requires the involvement of someone else which has, usually, substantial setbacks with other projects",DS
" Big Data working fluxes involves a finite number of changes and reruns, resulting in delays due to huge requests from the advance analytical abilities persona",DS
" The person closes to the business user, the dataخ‌ orخ‌ businessخ‌ analyst,خ‌ canâ€™tخ‌ perform by himself a large part of the work and in this way time that runs between interrogations and insight informationâ€™s records significant delays",DS
" In fact, most of the times, decisions are taken based on limited informationâ€™s, before the results from working Big Data flux came back",DS
" Because of it, fast and independent access of data analysts and capabilities given and powerful tools, are the core of the humanization of data",DS
" Following will discuss about the emancipation of the analyst role existing in company by upgrading them to wizard rank, capable to extract important insight, backing up the decisional factors with informationâ€™s that help taking fast and fully informed decisions",DS
" Big Data humanization makes that â€™large volumes of dataâ€™ to become accesible for analysts in the companies, offering the abilities availables, most of the time, only for IT (Information Technology) department",DS
" Makig possible presenting the data as informations, easy accessible and related to the subjects",DS
 Is about an analysis based on Big Data effortless and in a natural manner,DS
" In order not to focus strictly on software development and statistic abilities, data obtained can be humanize by adding right context and by offering simple and direct tools for building analitic applications",DS
" Big Data humanization means direct work with data, in such a way that they cand tell their story",DS
" The complete image leads, in this way, to insight business",DS
" Meaning, also, a new oportunity for data analysts to perfect their art and to extend the capacity of independent way of analysis",DS
" They become, from data wizers specialists in data analysis",DS

" They become, from data wizers specialists in data analysis",DS
" In the past, data analysts requared advance knowleage of statistics and business",DS
" In this moment, being able to access to analytic and contextual data tools, which usually were accessible only to data experts and IT, the analysts can become masters of data",DS
" A wizerd is a person that takes raw materials (data in our case) and uses their skill, knowledge and vision to create something of unique value",DS
" Data wizerds have a superior understanding not only over the data they observe, but also also the business and its problems",DS
" Because the data wizers understand data and business so well that they can provide the right tools to use, obtaining in this way the most suitable results and ways to aply , several times, for business problems",DS
 Work of data wizerds is the essence of Big Data humanization,DS
 Data wizerds are â€کhumanization mastersâ€™خ‌ when talking about Big Data,DS
" They create data and analytic working fluxs that revel the true story, regardless if they deliver an answer to a specific questions or a new application for business users at the end of the process",DS
 Is considered by the data analysts that the given data by the automatic sensors will generate the next wave of growing in production and technological innovation,DS
" Statistic reports show, for example, that being engines witch are working on the planes in use worldwide have reached the point of generatingخ‌ 10خ‌ TBخ‌ ofخ‌ dataخ‌ andخ‌ informationâ€™sخ‌ for every half of hour of functioning",DS
 A line plane with four engines can generate 640 TB of data for one flight across Atlantic,DS
 If the number is multiplied by over 25,DS
"000 flights every day, the obtained volume of data is overwhelming",DS
" Until now, almost all this data was lost at the end of the flight, but things are going to change",DS
" Why? Thanks to the tools and technology of Big Data, now ca identify, store, redraw and analyze the data in an efficient manner regarding costs and time use",DS
" This will provide huge opportunities, for example in the area on maintenance and defects prevision for planes â€“ with direct effects in reducing the flights delays and cancelation reasons due to technical defects on planes",DS
 The example given above is not unique,DS
" The practice case of the data obtained by sensors can be now efficiently analysis, in real time, in several activity areas",DS
" For example, intelligent sensors used in electric networks can generate large volumes of data which can be used to increase productivity",DS
" As agriculture and agricol industry is considered one of the strategic engines of operating the romanian economy in the future, one case study has showed that using Big Data in an agricol area in USA might raise the interest to use such solutions to increase efficiency of production also in Romania",DS
" Concret, is about a project taking place in Flint Valley River, a land specific for agriculture from south-west of Georgia",DS
" At the finish of this project, the landlords from the are will receive extrem precice forecast, each one for his specific farm from three days ahead",DS
" Around this time, a team of resurcers from Flint River Soil and Water Conservation District, American Agricultural Department, Georgia University and IBM are using Big Data sophisticated tools to analyze big volumes of forecast weather data, geografic, historical and of other nature",DS
 The purpose is to pathern the forcast phenomenons to a very precise manner then the ones we already have available today,DS
" This kinds of forecasts will help the farmers to make smart decisions related to watering solutions, sowing, harvest and soil fertilization, that will permit them to better use the water supply and increase the volume of the harvest",DS
 Flint River Valley represents an important part of Agricola industry in the state of Georgia,DS
 The farms from this region of 27 districts represent an annual income of around 2 billions dollars at the revenues of United States,DS
" With approximately ten years back, the authority of water conservation from this region signed a partnership with American Agriculture Department, University of Georgia and other local, regional and state agencies to promote the practices of conservation the use water between farmers of the area",DS
 The effort done in the meantime has already started to provide important results,DS
 One so called VRI technology (Variable Rate Irrigation) developed by resources from Georgiaâ€™sخ‌Universityخ‌hasخ‌passedخ‌fastخ‌fromخ‌theخ‌ concept state to a commercial product,DS
" Based on GPS, this technology allows farmers to arrange the water sprinklers, in such a way that the water will be use efficient only in the needed areas by redirecting the jets",DS
 The project linked to Big Data using for efficient forecast pattern is the second big project developed by the entities named above and has no release date yet,DS
 The outcome at the end of this project will generate improved forecasts and also mobility by using intelligent devices like pads and smart phones,DS
" Regardless the general positive phenomenon over the efficiency of forensic data analysis, the study shows that the majority of companies are not working with big enough data in comparison with the corporative income",DS
 Only 18% of intern audit specialists interviewed are working with large volumes over a million records,DS
" Between them, the ones in financial business, only 21% have declaimed to work with large volumes of data of approximately or over milion recordings, a low percent for a concentration segment of data",DS
" Per assemble, 71% of the companies with revenues over 1 billion USD are working with sets of data under 1 million recordings",DS
" The usage of smaller volumes of data than expected, in comparison with the companies revenues, are an indication that many companies can miss important opportunity to prevent and identify defraud just because they are not working with large volumes of data",DS
" Forensic data analysis advance tools, like statistic analysis and mining data technologies, are used only by 10% of the ones questioned",DS
" Is not, as result, a big surprise the fact that the bigger challenge mentioned regarding forensic data analysis is ""obtaining the necessary expertise or the suitable tools """,DS
" From the study, as conclusion, that the support of the efforts of using forensic data analysis inside the company seems like a key task",DS
" So, 62% of the questions ones have stated that is necessary to improve awareness in management team over the benefits given by forensic data analysis",DS
" Interesting is the fact that the one responsible are not considering the costs as a major obstacle, Most of the organizations have on their hands mountains of data that they could use in making decisions",DS
" The possibilities are infinite when answering business questions by companyâ€™s using data accumulated in Data Warehouse and, in the same manner, in data base unstructured or text format generated by Social Media",DS

"Game design is a large field, drawing from the fields of computer science/programming, creative writing, and graphic design",GD
 Game designers take the creative lead in imagining and bringing to life video game worlds,GD
" This article helps international students understand the nature of game design, distinguishes the discipline from other specialized game degrees and identifies the capacities in which game design graduates will be prepared to serve on a development team when working in a studio",GD
"Video games are a thriving industry both in the US and abroad, and the number of careers pertaining to the creation of video games has increased exponentially",GD
" Seizing on this trend, a growing number of international students have decided to take their passion for playing video games and turn it into a career in game design",GD
" Designing video games is a dream job for many gamers, and the reasons that are making the decision to study game design so popular are plenty; the video game industry is home to diverse job opportunities, enjoyable and fun work environments and high starting salaries",GD
 International students who study game design will be on their way to a career that thrives on creativity and imagination,GD
"However, not everyone who enjoys playing video games will enjoy creating them",GD
" In fact, creating a video game is a long and complex process with many subsequent tasks and roles required to make a finished, playable product",GD
" To successfully study game design, an international student will need to inquire about more than just the fun they will have being immersed in game-related curriculum",GD
" In order to know whether a degree in game design is right for them, international students will need to ask, ""What is game design?""",GD
"So, what is game design? Game design is a subset of the field of video game development",GD
 Game design is a field with a broad focus,GD
" As such, the skills of a game designer are drawn from the fields of computer science and programming, creative writing and graphic design",GD
" Game designers take the creative lead in imagining and bringing to life video game stories, characters, gameplay, rules, interfaces, dialogue and environments",GD
" This being the case, a game designer is a cross between a writer, artist and programmer",GD
" It is an individual who presents a comprehensive artistic vision, while also possessing the technical skill to oversee and contribute to programming, image rendering, level design, digital editing and other construction aspects of game design",GD
A game designer's role on a development team differs from the specialized roles of graphic designers and programmers,GD
" Graphic designers and game programmers have specific tasks to accomplish in the division of labor that goes into creating a video game, international students can major in those specific disciplines if desired",GD
" However, international students who study game design in the US will be groomed to create their own video game from the ground up as well as take on a role on a development team",GD
" That being the case, international students who study game design must decide what role on a development team they would like to have upon graduation",GD
" Once a desired role has been established, an international student should then subsequently fine-tune to the degree they are to receive",GD
 This will ensure that they are optimally prepared for that particular role on a development team until they have the industry credibility necessary in order to be given the reins over creating their very own title,GD
"Game design is a diverse field that will equip graduates to both design and create their own video game universe, but what are the roles on a development team that game designers hold prior to being a lead designer? ",GD
"Level designer:Game writer/storyline developer:Game artist/content designer:Programmer/system designer:World designer:Interface designer:International students who study game design will become familiar with both the overall process of creating a video game as well as the individual elements of software engineering, programming and graphic design utilized in the actual construction of the game",GD
" In order to get the most out of studying game design and to increase the chance of a quick advance on a development team, international students should decide on a specific area of specialization ahead of time",GD
"Despite the initial excitement and allure that comes with pursuing a dream occupation like game design, international students who want to get the most out of their decision to study game design in the United States will have to begin by asking important questions like, ""What is game design?"" Asking these types of preparatory questions will ensure that international students interested in designing their own video games are equipped to effectively contribute to game design teams until they are given the lead on their own project",GD
"Game design is the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes",GD
" Increasingly, elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions, in the form of gamification",GD
" Game designer and developer Robert Zubek defines game design by breaking it down into its elements, which he says are the following:Gameplay, which is the interaction between the player and the mechanics and systems",GD
"Mechanics and systems, which are the rules and objects in the game",GD
"Player experience, which is how users feel when they're playing the game",GD
"Games such as board games, card games, dice games, casino games, role-playing games, sports, video games, war games, or simulation games benefit from the principles of game design",GD
"Academically, game design is part of game studies, while game theory studies strategic decision making (primarily in non-game situations)",GD
" Games have historically inspired seminal research in the fields of probability, artificial intelligence, economics, and optimization theory",GD
 Applying game design to itself is a current research topic in metadesign,GD
" Tabletop games played today whose descent can be traced from ancient times include chess, go, pachisi, backgammon, mahjong, mancala, and pick-up sticks",GD
" The rules of these games were not codified until early modern times and their features gradually evolved and changed over time, through the folk process",GD
" Given this, these games are not considered to have had a designer or been the result of a design process in the modern sense",GD
"After the rise of commercial game publishing in the late 19th century, many games that had formerly evolved via folk processes became commercial properties, often with custom scoring pads or preprepared material",GD
" For example, the similar public domain games Generala, Yacht, and Yatzy led to the commercial game Yahtzee in the mid-1950s",GD
"Today, many commercial games, such as Taboo, Balderdash, Pictionary, or Time's Up!, are descended from traditional parlour games",GD
 Adapting traditional games to become commercial properties is an example of game design,GD
"Similarly, many sports, such as soccer and baseball, are the result of folk processes, while others were designed, such as basketball, invented in 1891 by James Naismith",GD
 Technological advances have provided new media for games throughout history,GD
"The printing press allowed packs of playing cards, adapted from Mahjong tiles, to be mass-produced, leading to many new card games",GD
 Accurate topographic maps produced as lithographs and provided free to Prussian officers helped popularize wargaming,GD
 Cheap bookbinding (printed labels wrapped around cardboard) led to mass-produced board games with custom boards,GD
 Inexpensive (hollow) lead figurine casting contributed to the development of miniature wargaming,GD
 Cheap custom dice led to poker dice,GD
 Flying discs led to disc golf and Ultimate,GD
" Personal computers contributed to the popularity of computer games, leading to the wide availability of video game consoles and video games",GD
 Smart phones have led to a proliferation of mobile games,GD
The first games in a new medium are frequently adaptations of older games,GD
" Pong, one of the first widely disseminated video games, adapted table tennis",GD
 Later games will often exploit the distinctive properties of a new medium,GD
 Adapting older games and creating original games for new media are both examples of game design,GD
" Game studies or gaming theory is a discipline that deals with the critical study of games, game design, players, and their role in society and culture",GD
" Prior to the late-twentieth century, the academic study of games was rare and limited to fields such as history and anthropology",GD
" As the video game revolution took off in the early 1980s, so did academic interest in games, resulting in a field that draws on diverse methodologies and schools of thought",GD
" These influences may be characterized broadly in three ways: the social science approach, the humanities approach, and the industry and engineering approach",GD
"Broadly speaking, the social scientific approach has concerned itself with the question of ""What do games do to people?"" Using tools and methods such as surveys, controlled laboratory experiments, and ethnography researchers have investigated both the positive and negative impacts that playing games could have on people",GD
" More sociologically informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life",GD
"In general terms, the humanities approach has concerned itself with the question of ""What meanings are made through games?"" Using tools and methods such as interviews, ethnographies, and participant observation, researchers have investigated the various roles that videogames play in people's lives and activities together with the meaning they assign to their experiences",GD
" From an industry perspective, a lot of game studies research can be seen as the academic response to the videogame industry's questions regarding the products it creates and sells",GD
" The main question this approach deals with can be summarized as ""How can we create better games?"" with the accompanying ""What makes a game good?"" ""Good"" can be taken to mean many different things, including providing an entertaining and engaging experience, being easy to learn and play, and being innovative, and having novel experiences",GD
 Different approaches to studying this problem have included looking at describing how to design and extracting guidelines and rules of thumb for making better games,GD
 Game theory is a study of strategic decision making,GD
" Specifically, it is ""the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers""",GD
"An alternative term suggested ""as a more descriptive name for the discipline"" is interactive decision theory",GD
"[12] The subject first addressed zero-sum games, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants",GD
"Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science",GD
The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects,GD
" To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the players of the game, the information and actions available to each player at each decision point, and the payoffs for each outcome",GD
" (Rasmusen refers to these four ""essential elements"" by the acronym ""PAPI""",GD
")A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a solution concept of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy",GD
 These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the gameâ€”a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability,GD
" Games can be characterized by ""what the player doesand what the player experiences",GD
 This is often referred to as gameplay,GD
 Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game,GD
 Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e,GD
g,GD
" miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer)",GD
" In places where the use of leather is well established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, football, cricket, tennis, and volleyball",GD
 Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region,GD
" Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards",GD
 Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces,GD
"Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things",GD
" A token may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a point scored",GD
"Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not utilise any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment",GD
 Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered,GD
" For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars",GD
Most games require multiple players,GD
 Single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces,GD
" Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a single-player game is against an element of the environment, against one's own skills, against time, or against chance",GD
" This is also true of cooperative games, in which multiple players share a common goal and win or lose together",GD
"Many games described as ""single-player"" or ""cooperative"" could alternatively be described as puzzles or recreations, in that they do not involve strategic behavior (as defined by game theory), in which the expected reaction of an opponent to a possible move becomes a factor in choosing which move to make",GD
Games against opponents simulated with artificial intelligence differ from other single-player games in that the algorithms used usually do incorporate strategic behavior,GD
Stories told in games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through the use of mechanics and player choice,GD
 Narrative plots in games generally have a clearly defined and simplistic structure,GD
 Mechanical choices on the part of the designer(s) often drastically affect narrative elements in the game,GD
" However, due to a lack of unified and standardized teaching and understanding of narrative elements in games, individual interpretations, methods, and terminology vary wildly",GD
" Because of this, most narrative elements in games are created unconsciously and intuitively",GD
" However, as a general rule, game narratives increase in complexity and scale as player choice or game mechanics increase in complexity and scale",GD
 One example of this is removing a players ability to directly affect the plot for a limited time,GD
 This lack of player choice necessitates an increase in mechanical complexity and could be used as a metaphor to symbolize depression that is felt by a character in the narrative,GD
"A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly",GD
"Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and horseshoes, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess",GD
" Games of strategy include checkers, chess, go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them",GD
" Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, mah-jongg, roulette, etc",GD
"), as well as snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice",GD
Most games contain two or all three of these elements,GD
" For example, American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance",GD
" Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne",GD
"By learning through play[a] children can develop social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments",GD
"[16] Key ways that young children learn include playing, being with other people, being active, exploring and new experiences, talking to themselves, communicating with others, meeting physical and mental challenges, being shown how to do new things, practicing and repeating skills, and having fun",GD
"Play develops children's content knowledge and provides children the opportunity to develop social skills, competencies, and disposition to learn",GD
 Play-based learning is based on a Vygotskian model of scaffolding where the teacher pays attention to specific elements of the play activity and provides encouragement and feedback on children's learning,GD
"When children engage in real-life and imaginary activities, play can be challenging in children's thinking",GD
" To extend the learning process, sensitive intervention can be provided with adult support when necessary during play-based learning",GD
Game design is part of a game's development from concept to its final form,GD
" Typically, the development process is an iterative process, with repeated phases of testing and revision",GD
" During revision, additional design or re-design may be needed",GD
"A game designer (or inventor) is the person who invents a game's concept, its central mechanisms, and its rules",GD
"Often, the game designer also invents the game's title and, if the game isn't abstract, its theme",GD
" Sometimes these activities are done by the game publisher, not the designer, or maybe dictated by a licensed property (such as when designing a game based on a film)",GD
"A game developer is the person who fleshes out the details of a game's design, oversees its testing, and revises the game in response to player feedback",GD
"Often the game designer is also its developer, although some publishers do extensive development of games to suit their particular target audience after licensing a game from a designer",GD
" For larger games, such as collectible card games and most video games, a team is used and the designer and developer roles are usually split among multiple people",GD
A game artist is an artist who creates art for one or more types of games,GD
" Game artists are often vital to and credited in role-playing games, collectible card games and video games",GD
"Many graphic elements of games are created by the designer when producing a prototype of the game, revised by the developer based on testing, and then further refined by the artist and combined with artwork as a game is prepared for publication or release",GD
Video game artists are responsible for all of the aspects of game development that call for visual art,GD
"A game concept is an idea for a game, briefly describing its core play mechanisms, who the players represent, and how they win or lose",GD
"A game concept may be ""pitched"" to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are pitched to potential film producers",GD
" Alternatively, game publishers holding a game license to intellectual property in other media may solicit game concepts from several designers before picking one to design a game, typically paying the designer in advance against future royalties",GD
"During design, a game concept is fleshed out",GD
" Mechanisms are specified in terms of components (boards, cards, on-screen entities, etc",GD
) and rules,GD
" The play sequence and possible player actions are defined, as well as how the game starts, ends, and what is its winning condition",GD
" In video games, storyboards and screen mockups may be created",GD
A game prototype is a draft version of a game used for testing,GD
" Typically, creating a prototype marks the shift from game design to game development and testing",GD
" Although prototyping in regards to human-computer interaction and interaction design are both studied, the use of prototyping in game design has remained relatively unexplored",GD
" It's known that game design has clear benefits from prototyping, such as exploring new game design possibilities and technologies, the field of game design has different characteristics than other types of software industries that consider prototyping in game design in a different category and need a new perspectiveGame testing is a major part of game development",GD
" During testing, players play the game and provide feedback on its gameplay, the usability of its components or screen elements, the clarity of its goals and rules, ease of learning, and enjoyment to the game developer",GD
" The developer then revises the design, its components, presentation, and rules before testing it again",GD
 Later testing may take place with focus groups to test consumer reactions before publication,GD
"During testing, various balance issues may be identified, requiring changes to the game's design",GD
Video game testing is a software testing process for quality control of video games,GD
 The primary function of game testing is the discovery and documentation of software defects (aka bugs),GD
" Interactive entertainment software testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, analytic competence, critical evaluation skills, and endurance",GD
" The design of role-playing games requires the establishment of setting, characters, and basic gameplay rules or mechanics",GD
" After a role-playing game is produced, additional design elements are often devised by the players themselves",GD
" In many instances, for example, character creation is left to the players",GD
" Likewise, the progression of a role-playing game is determined in large part by the gamemaster whose individual campaign design may be directed by one of several role-playing game theories",GD
There is no central core for tabletop role-playing game theory because different people want such different things out of the games,GD
" Probably the most famous category of RPG theory, GNS Theory assumes that people want one of three things out of the game â€“ a better, more interestingly challenging game, to create a more interesting story, or a better simulation â€“ in other words better rules to support worldbuilding",GD
" GNS Theory has been abandoned by its creator, partly because it neglects emotional investment, and partly because it just didn't work properly",GD
 There are techniques that people use (such as dice pools) to better create the game they want â€“ but with no consistent goal or agreement for what makes for a good game there's no overarching theory generally agreed on,GD
Video game design is a process that takes place in the pre-production phase of video game development,GD
" In the video game industry, game design describes the creation of the content and rules of a video game",GD
The goal of this process for the game designer is to provide players with the opportunity to make meaningful decisions in relation to playing the game,GD
"[42] Elements of video game design such as the establishment of fundamental gameplay rules provide a framework within which players will operate, while the addition of narrative structures provide players with a reason to care about playing the game",GD
"To establish the rules and narrative, an internally consistent game world is created, requiring visual, audio, and programming development for world, character, and level design",GD
 The amount of work that is required to accomplish this often demands the use of a design team which may be divided into smaller game design disciplines,GD
"[44] In order to maintain internal consistency between the teams, a specialized software design document known as a ""game design document"" (and sometimes an even broader scope ""game bible"" document) provides overall contextual guidance on ambient mood, appropriate tone, and other less tangible aspects of the game world",GD
 video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development â€“ the process and related disciplines of creating video games,GD
" A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks] to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc",GD
 Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support,GD
[4] Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games,GD
"A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as Nintendo's Switch, Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S, Sony's PlayStation 5), or may develop for a number of systems (including personal computers and mobile devices)",GD
[citation needed] Video game developers specialize in certain types of games (such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters),GD
" Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another",GD
" Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games",GD
"Most video game publishers maintain development studios (such as Electronic Arts's EA Canada, Square Enix's studios, Activision's Radical Entertainment, Nintendo EPD and Sony's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog)",GD
" However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as ""publishers"" rather than ""developers""",GD
 Developers may be private as well,GD
"In the video game industry, a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a video game console and develops exclusively for it",GD
" First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as Nintendo), have a specific division name (such as Sony's Polyphony Digital) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as Rare or Naughty Dog)",GD
"[6] Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge financial investment on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner",GD
"[7] However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits",GD
"[7] Current examples of first-party studios include PlayStation Studios for Sony, and Xbox Game Studios for Microsoft",GD
"Second-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and develop games exclusive to that platform, i",GD
 a non-owned developer making games for a first-party company,GD
"[8] As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers",GD
"[7] These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games for other publishers if they choose to",GD
" For example, while HAL Laboratory initially began developing games on personal computers like the MSX, they became one of the earliest second-party developers for Nintendo, developing exclusively for Nintendo's consoles starting with the Famicom, though they would self-publish their mobile games",GD
"A third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title",GD
 Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's design and content,GD
" However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer",GD
"The business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time",GD
" By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations",GD
" When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on royalties",GD
 Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers,GD
" Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams",GD
" Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer",GD
" Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived",GD
"A common exit strategy for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer",GD
 In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers,GD
" One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense",GD
Activision in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,GD
" When four Atari, Inc",GD
" programmers left the company following its sale to Warner Communications, partially over the lack of respect that the new management gave to programmers, they used their knowledge of how Atari VCS game cartridges were programmed to create their own games for the system, founding Activision in 1979 to sell these",GD
" Atari took legal action to try to block sale of these games, but the companies ultimately settled, with Activision agreeing to pay a portion of their sales as a license fee to Atari for developing for the console",GD
 This established the use of licensing fees as a model for third-party development that persists into the present,GD
"[11][12] The licensing fee approach was further enforced by Nintendo when it decided to allow other third-party developers to make games for the Famicom console, setting a 30% licensing fee that covered game cartridge manufacturing costs and development fees",GD
" The 30% licensing fee for third-party developers has also persisted to the present, being a de facto rate used for most digital storefronts for third-party developers to offer their games on the platform",GD
"In recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers",GD
" While these development teams are now technically ""in-house"", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices)",GD
" For example, Activision acquired Raven (1997); Neversoft (1999),whichmergedwith InfinityWard 2014; ",GD
Axis (2001); Treyarch (2001); Luxoflux (2002); Shaba (2002); Infinity Ward (2003) and Vicarious Visions (2005),GD
" All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details",GD
 Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers,GD
"A developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product",GD
" Such tools may be a database, Voice over IP, or add-in interface software; this is also known as middleware",GD
 Examples of this include SpeedTree and Havoc,GD
Independents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher,GD
" Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the Internet and word of mouth for publicity",GD
" Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo",GD
" With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games",GD
Other indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms,GD
"[citation needed] In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs)",GD
"[14]Video game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire",GD
 Many workers find this type of environment rewarding and pleasant professionally and personally,GD
"[15] However, the industry also requires long working hours from its employees (sometimes to an extent seen as unsustainable)",GD
[16] Employee burnout is not uncommon,GD
"[15]An entry-level programmer can make, on average, over $66,000 annually only if they are successful in obtaining a position in a medium to large video game company",GD
" An experienced game-development employee, depending on their expertise and experience, averaged roughly $73,000 in 2007",GD
" Indie game developers may only earn between $10,000 and $50,000 a year depending on how financially successful their titles are",GD
"In addition to being part of the software industry,[citation needed] game development is also within the entertainment industry; most sectors of the entertainment industry (such as films and television) require long working hours and dedication from their employees, such as willingness to relocate and/or required to develop games that do not appeal to their personal taste",GD
" The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts labor to the industry, creating a competitive labor market which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees",GD
" Industry communities, such as the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause significant deterioration in its employees' quality of life",GD
" Some video game developers and publishers have been accused of the excessive invocation of ""crunch time""",GD
Crunch time is the point at which the team is thought to be failing to achieve milestones needed to launch a game on schedule,GD
" The complexity of work flow, reliance on third-party deliverables, and the intangibles of artistic and aesthetic demands in video-game creation create difficulty in predicting milestones",GD
" The use of crunch time is also seen to be exploitative of the younger male-dominated workforce in video games, who have not had the time to establish a family and who were eager to advance within the industry by working long hours",GD
" Because crunch time tends to come from a combination of corporate practices as well as peer influence, the term ""crunch culture"" is often used to discuss video game development settings where crunch time may be seen as the norm rather than the exception",GD
"The use of crunch time as a workplace standard gained attention first in 2004, when Erin Hoffman exposed the use of crunch time at Electronic Arts, a situation known as the ""EA Spouses"" case",GD
" A similar ""Rockstar Spouses"" case gained further attention in 2010 over working conditions at Rockstar San Diego",GD
"Since then, there has generally been negative perception of crunch time from most of the industry as well as from its consumers and other medi Game development had generally been a predominately male workforce",GD
" In 1989, according to Variety, women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry, while a 2017 IGDA survey found that the female demographic in game development had risen to about 20%",GD
" Taking into account that a 2017 ESA survey found 41% of video game players were female, this represented a significant gender gap in game development",GD
" The male-dominated industry, most who have grown up playing video games and are part of the video game culture, can create a culture of ""toxic geek masculinity"" within the workplace",GD
"In addition, the conditions behind crunch time are far more discriminating towards women as this requires them to commit time exclusively to the company or to more personal activities like raising a family",GD
" These factors established conditions within some larger development studios where female developers have found themselves discriminated in workplace hiring and promotion, as well as the target of sexual harassment",GD
"[34] This can be coupled from similar harassment from external groups, such as during the 2014 Gamergate controversy",GD
"[35] Major investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that went unchecked by management, as well as discrimination by employers, have been brought up against Riot Games, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard in the late 2010s and early 2020s, alongside smaller studios and individual developers",GD
" However, while other entertainment industries have had similar exposure through the Me Too movement and have tried to address the symptoms of these problems industry-wide, the video game industry has yet to have its Me Too-moment, even as late as 2021",GD
 There also tends to be pay-related discrimination against women in the industry,GD
" According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made",GD
" Game designing women had the closest equity, making 96 cents for every dollar men made in the same job, while audio professional women had the largest gap, making 68% of what men in the same position made",GD
 Increasing the representation of women in the video game industry required breaking a feedback loop of the apparent lack of female representation in the production of video games and in the content of video games,GD
" Efforts have been made to provide a strong STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) background for women at the secondary education level, but there are issues with tertiary education such as at colleges and universities, where game development programs tend to reflect the male-dominated demographics of the industry, a factor that may led women with strong STEM backgrounds to choose other career goals",GD
" There is also a significant gap in racial minorities within the video game industry; a 2019 IGDA survey found only 2% of developers considered themselves to be of African descent and 7% Hispanic, while 81% were Caucasian; in contrast, 2018 estimates from the United States Census estimate the U",GD
S,GD
" population to be 13% of African descent and 18% HispanicIn a 2014 and 2015 survey of job positions and salaries, the IGDA found that people of color were both underrepresented in senior management roles as well as underpaid in comparison to white developers",GD
" Further, because video game developers typically draw from personal experiences in building game characters, this diversity gap has led to few characters of racial minority to be featured as main characters within video games",GD
 Minority developers have also been harassed from external groups due to the toxic nature of the video game culture,GD
" This racial diversity issue has similar ties to the gender one, and similar methods to result both have been suggested, such as improving grade school education, development of games that appeal beyond the white, male gamer stereotype, and identify toxic behavior in both video game workplaces and online communities that perpetuate discrimination against gender and race",GD
" In regards to LGBT and other gender or sexual orientations, the video game industry typically shares the same demographics as with the larger population based on a 2005 IGDA survey",GD
" Those of LGBT do not find workplace issues with their identity, though work to improve the representation of LGBT themes within video games in the same manner as with racial minorities",GD
"[44] However, LGBTdevelopers have also come under the same type of harassment from external groups like women and racial minorities due to the nature of the video game culture",GD
" The industry also is recognized to have an ageism issue, discriminating against the hiring and retention of older developers",GD
" A 2016 IGDA survey found only 3% of developers were over 50 years old, while at least two-thirds were between 20 and 34; these numbers show a far lower average age compared to the U",GD
S,GD
 national average of about 41,GD
9 that same year,GD
" While discrimination by age in hiring practices is generally illegal, companies often target their oldest workers first during layoffs or other periods of reduction",GD
 Older developers with experience may find themselves too qualified for the types of positions that other game development companies seek given salaries and compensations offered,GD
 Some of the larger video game developers and publishers have also engaged contract workers through agencies to help add manpower in game development in part to alleviate crunch time from employees,GD
" Contractors are brought on for a fixed period and generally work similar hours as full-time staff members, assisting across all areas of video game development, but as contractors, do not get any benefits such as paid time-off or health care from the employer; they also are typically not credited on games that they work on for this reason",GD
" The practice itself is legal and common in other engineering and technology areas, and generally it is expected that this is meant to lead into a full-time position, or otherwise the end of the contract",GD
" But more recently, its use in the video game industry has been compared to Microsoft's past use of ""permatemp"", contract workers that were continually renewed and treated for all purposes as employees but received no benefits",GD
" While Microsoft has waned from the practice, the video game industry has adapted it more frequently",GD
 Around 10% of the workforce in video games is estimated to be from contract labor,GD
" Similar to other tech industries, video game developers are typically not unionized",GD
" This is a result of the industry being driven more by creativity and innovation rather than production, the lack of distinction between management and employees in the white-collar area, and that the pace at which the industry moves that makes union actions difficult to plan out",GD
" However, when situations related to crunch time become prevalent in the news, there have typically been followup discussions towards the potential to form a union",GD
" A survey performed by the International Game Developers Association in 2014 found that more than half of the 2,200 developers surveyed favored unionization",GD
"[50] A similar survey of over 4,000 game developers run by the Game Developers Conference in early 2019 found that 47% of respondents felt the video game industry should unionize",GD
" In 2016, voice actors in the Screen Actors Guildâ€گAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union doing work for video games struck several major publishers, demanding better royalty payments and provisions related to the safety of their vocal performances, when their union's standard contract was up for renewal",GD
 The voice actor strike lasted for over 300 days into 2017 before a new deal was made between SAG-AFTRA and the publishers,GD
" While this had some effects on a few games within the industry, it brought to the forefront the question of whether video game developers should unionize",GD
" A grassroots movement, Game Workers Unite, was established around 2017 to discuss and debate issues related to unionization of game developers",GD
" The group came to the forefront during the March 2018 Game Developers Conference by holding a roundtable discussion with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), the professional association for developers",GD
" Statements made by the IGDA's current executive director Jen MacLean relating to IGDA's activities had been seen by as anti-union, and Game Workers Unite desired to start a conversation to lay out the need for developers to unionize",GD
" In the wake of the sudden near-closure of Telltale Games in September 2018, the movement again called out for the industry to unionize",GD
" The movement argued that Telltale had not given any warning to its 250 employees let go, having hired additional staff as recently as a week prior, and left them without pensions or health-care options; it was further argued that the studio considered this a closure rather than layoffs, as to get around failure to notify required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 preceding layoffs",GD
" The situation was argued to be ""exploitive"", as Telltale had been known to force its employees to frequently work under ""crunch time"" to deliver its games",GD
" By the end of 2018, a United Kingdom trade union, Game Workers Unite UK, an affiliate of the Game Workers Unite movement, had been legally established",GD
" Following Activision Blizzard's financial report for the previous quarter in February 2019, the company said that they would be laying off around 775 employees (about 8% of their workforce) despite having record profits for that quarter",GD
" Further calls for unionization came from this news, including the AFLâ€“CIO writing an open letter to video game developers encouraging them to unionize",GD
" Game Workers Unite and the Communications Workers of America established a new campaign to push for unionization of video game developers, the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE), in January 2020",GD
 Initial efforts for CODE were aimed to determine what approach to unionization would be best suited for the video game industry,GD
" Whereas some video game employees believe they should follow the craft-based model used by SAG-AFTRA which would unionized based on job function, others feel an industry-wide union, regardless of job position, would be better",GD
" Sweden presents a unique case where nearly all parts of its labor force, including white-collar jobs such as video game development, may engage with labor unions under the Employment Protection Act often through collective bargaining agreements",GD
 Developer DICE had reached its union agreements in 2004,GD
[60] Paradox Interactive became one of the first major publishers to supportunionization efforts in June 2020 with its own agreements to cover its Swedish employees within two laborunions Unionen and SACO,GD
" In Australia, video game developers could join other unions, but the first video game-specific union, Game Workers Unite Australia, was formed in December 2021 under Profession",GD
"video game developers could join other unions, but the first video game-specific union, Game Workers Unite Australia, was formed in December 2021 under Profession",GD
" Computer users have tasks they need to perform, and are therefore motivated to overcome poorly designed interfaces",GD
" With video games, there is no external motivation for the task â€” if the gameâ€™s interface is not compelling and entertaining, the product fails in the marketplace",GD
" Many aspects of game design, such as an attractor mode to draw users toward the game, have direct relevance to other domains, such as information kiosks",GD
" This panel will consist of video game designers who will relate their design methodologies, techniques, and other experiences which will help HCI designers create more compelling, engaging, and effective interfaces",GD
 The panel will consist of panelistsâ€™ presentations followed by a large allocation of time for interaction with the audienceâ€™s questions,GD
 The panelistsâ€™ presentations will include demonstration examples drawn from coin-operated and computer-based games,GD
 An interface is where one system touches or interacts with another system,GD
" For instance, we can think of a child as interfacing to a doll when cuddling it",GD
" However this is not the way we usually use the term in computer science where it has come to mean a third system, usually c)f widgets and control devices, that sits between the user and the â€œrealâ€‌ program",GD
" The doll/child rektionship is different: the child does not interface with the exterior of the doll to reach some deeper â€œdollnessâ€‌, and I be] ieve the same holds for video games",GD
 There are two areas where we can profitably talk about interfaces and video games,GD
" First, almost al I video games are interfaces between the (child and an elaborate scoring system",GD
 This system is tuned such that as the game progresses it is harder and harder to score points but the points are of larger and larger values,GD
 If done just correctly the effect is a near drug-like high in the child,GD
" Most games, it should be noted, fail at this task and hence at the store shelves",GD
" Second, there is a hardware device called a joystick (or pad or Glove) which interfaces between the child and the game",GD
" A good joystick does not automatically give a high score, but closes the eyelgamefhand feedback loop in such a way as to provide pleasure",GD
" Again, we find good and bad sticks in about the same ratio as good to bad spreadsheets",GD
" However, the child playing a video game is a dynamic system that over time will get better at playing games, will score higher points and will reach deeper levels even if the game interface remains constant",GD
 This implies actual changes to the child and the question can be raised as to the effect of these changes in interfacing to the rest of the 177 Panels CIDâ€™94- â€œCelebratingInterdependenceâ€‌ o Conference Companion !52! culture he or she is embedded in,GD
" It can be said that â€œa video gameâ€™s job is done when it is purchased from a rack at Toyâ€™s R Us, but the user it creates will last a life time",GD
â€‌ It is becoming belatedly understood that a computer programâ€™s success must be judged in a context that extends well beyond the desktop and so it is not clear that by finding the Princess we have found an interface,GD
" Rich Gold is a composer and cartoonist who co-founded the League of Automatic Music Composers, the first network computer band",GD
" As an internationally known artist he invented the field of Algorithmic Symbolism, an example of which, The Party Planner, was featured in Scientific American",GD
" He was head of the sound and music department of Sega USAâ€™s coin-operated video game division and the inventor of the award winning Little Computer People (Activision), the first fully autonomous computerized person you could buy",GD
" For five years he headed the electronic and computer toy research area at Mattel Toys and was the manager of, among other interactive gizmos, the Mattel Power Glove",GD
" After working as a consultant in Virtual Reality he joined Xerox PARC, where he is now a researcher working on ubiquitous computing, an artist in residence program, tiny hand held devices and the philosophy of stuff Tim Skelly: The Design Process& Usability Testing There are many diverse categories of video games: arcade game beat-em-ups, computer-based graphic adventures, puzzles, simulations of societies and simulations of flight",GD
 It is a pleasant and self-motivating condition that would be desirable in any user,GD
" The way each video game facilitates reaching that state is similar from one game to the next: Step one, present a goal; Step two, provide clear-cut feedback to the user as to their progress towards the goal; Step three, (and this is the step at which good video games excel) constantly adjust the gameâ€™s challenges to a level slightly beyond the current abilities of the player",GD
 How each game designer deals with that challenge usually depends on the economic realities of the marketplace,GD
" Luckily, video games are virtually all interface",GD
 No one can complain that the product is shipping without enough development resources devoted to UI,GD
 PC-based games live or die in the same marketplace as more conventional software,GD
" Developers of this class of games, like their â€کproductivity toolâ€™ counterparts, must contend with marketing promises and guesses, and evershifting deadlines",GD
" As such, an examination of PC-based game development offers few novel guide posts towards effective UI",GD
" Coin-operated arcade games exist in the same economic world as jukeboxes, pinball machines and vending machines",GD
" How does UI development differ here? Video game players are users that will turn away from a bad product at the drop of a quarter, Because of this, coin-operated game distributors will not buy arcade games that do not have promising coin-collection reports",GD
 This means that arcade game developers must put their machines through the most brutal usability testing in the software world â€” prototype games on location with real players spending real money,GD
" For an arcade game to show large weekly earnings, the game interface must cater to a playerâ€™s every need",GD
" Players must be able to immediately understand how to operate the game, and user help (if necessary at all) must be fully â€کcontext sensitive",GD
â€™ Success rates improve when products undergo exhaustive testing and iterative redesign,GD
" Designers of coin-operated games and programmers follow these vital development disciplines, not because they think it is a good idea, but because manufacturers of coin-operated video games canâ€™t even give away their failures",GD
 Tim Skelly is a Researcher with Microsoftâ€™s Advanced Technology group,GD
" A fifteen year veteran of the video game industry, his credits include the worldâ€™s first cooperated video game, Rip-Off, the FASA BattleTech Center and SEGAâ€™S Sonic the Hedgehog II",GD
 David Thiei: Effective Use of Sound in Games All video games are not paragons ,GD
 of virtue in their use of sound,GD
 They are just a venue where a lot of implementation energy has produced a considerable body of work in a new field,GD
" Much can be learned from the things that video games (and pinball machines) have done with auditory feedback, both right and wrong",GD
 Within the framework of the previous statement I will discuss some of examples that deal with issues emerging from the following questions:,GD
 Is there a difference between interactive sound and traditional music and sound post-production?,GD
 What are the challenges and constraints that interaction places on sound designs for user interfaces? ,GD
 What kind of sound production capability is nominal for good user interface interaction? ,GD
 Does music have a place in interface? ,GD
 Who is equipped to do it? David Thiel joined Microsoft Research in July 1993,GD
" David has designed and implemented sound drivers used in over 70 interactive entertainment products; in all cases providing sound effects, voice and music",GD
 In 1990 David was the project manager and designer for four video games using a novel gesture-based input device,GD
 He demonstrated these games at the Vh-tual Reality Gallery of SIGGRAPH,GD
 Adlib and Yamaha have contracted David as an FM synthesis consultant,GD
 He most recently wrote the English manual for Yamahaâ€™s FM synthesizer chip 0PL3,GD
 David has experience in all forms of commercial synthesis and has written sound drivers that provide responsive sound support for asynchronous interaction,GD
 Game design is one of the most misused terms in use today,GD
" Some seek to learn game design, but learn game art instead",GD
 Still others learn pure programming,GD
" While programming and art are important fields and indeed incredibly important to digital games, game design is its own art form and has been around long before computers, polygons, and even the discovery of electricity",GD
 It is these basic principles of game design that we cover in this bookâ€”design distilled down to its basic essence,GD
" Not surprisingly, many of todayâ€™s greatest game designers got their start playing and designing non-digital games, and some still use paper prototyping in their present-day designs",GD
" When thinking of game design, think in terms of the board game Go, a Chinese game thousands of years old (see Figure 1",GD
 It requires no computer programming or polygon models to play,GD
" Yet its rules, simple as they are, allow for a depth of strategy so great that it is still played heavily today",GD
" While many of the games enjoyed today may not be as popular as Go a thousand years from now, there is no reason why such a game could not be created",GD
" If you are interested in game design but donâ€™t have any industry credits as a designer, you may find the experience in each chapter enlightening",GD
" Start with Chapter 1, â€œThe Basics,â€‌ to get an idea of the kinds of skills and core knowledge youâ€™ll need",GD
" For every other chapter, after reading the text, we recommend playing a commercial or indie game of that type if you havenâ€™t already, and follow it up by doing some or all of the challenges at the end to practice your new skills",GD
" If you are doing this on your own (for example, not as assigned work for a class), you may be drawn to the challenges that look easy; resist this temptation",GD
 Find exactly those exercises that look daunting or just plain un-fun; those are the ones that will best build the skills you want to build,GD
" If you are lucky enough to have some other colleagues who are as interested in game design as you, you will get better results by working in a group with them (think of it as a book club, except more fun)",GD
 Many of the challenges in this book suggest working in a group for brainstorming; you will get very different results if you go it alone,GD
" If you are looking to become a game designer some day, save the work that you create for these challenges",GD
 They can be used to fill out your design portfolio,GD
" There is no substitute for designing a video game that is fully implemented (such a piece should be the foundation of your portfolio), but additional work that shows your approach to common design problems in the field will give potential employers a better sense of what kind of designer you are, and a particularly innovative solution to a challenge in this book can be a talking point during an interview",GD
" If you are a student and this textbook was required for one of your game design classes, this is not one of those books that you want to get rid of at the end of the course",GD
" There are far too many chapters and exercises here to cover in a single quarter or semester, but every chapter and every challenge is meant to be useful to a game designer",GD
" After the course is over, try reading some of the chapters that you didnâ€™t get to cover in class and even doing the challenges",GD
 You can use winter or summer break as an excuse to play around with this book,GD
" Even if you donâ€™t, you may become a game designer some dayâ€¦ and if you do, you will want to practice your skills so that you can be the best designer you can be",GD
 Good game design is player-centric,GD
" That means that above all else, the player and her desires are truly considered",GD
" Rather than demanding that she do something via the rules, the gameplay itself should inherently motivate the player in the direction the designer wants her to go",GD
 Telling players they must travel around the board or advance to the next level is one thing,GD
" If they donâ€™t have a reason and a desire to do it, then it becomes torture",GD
" In creating a game, designers take a step back and think from the playerâ€™s viewpoint: Whatâ€™s this game about? How do I play? How do I win? Why do I want to play? What things do I need to do?",GD
" For instance, games in the Ratchet & Clank series are about blowing stuff up in fun and creative ways",GD
" Risk, Carcassonne, and Go are about acquiring territory",GD
" A core is usually tied to a specific â€œcore mechanic,â€‌ be it blowing your enemies away, flipping over tiles on your turn, or selling units to another person",GD
" These core mechanics can, in turn, lead to â€œcore dynamics,â€‌ which is a particular pattern of play",GD
" In the industry, when someone says â€œcore,â€‌ the dynamic is typically what they are referring to",GD
" â€œCore statementsâ€‌ (sometimes called the gameâ€™s â€œvisionâ€‌) are usually written by the development team to reflect the core mechanic or the core dynamic and sum up what the game is about, often in a single sentence",GD
" â€œThis game is aboutâ€¦â€‌ â€œThis game is the experience of beingâ€¦â€‌ â€œThis game teachesâ€¦â€‌ â€œThis game simulates the experience ofâ€¦â€‌ As is well known by those who have tried to pitch their game to a publisher, if you canâ€™t sum up your game in two sentences, you donâ€™t have a game",GD
" In games, the following core dynamics tend to show up again and again: Territorial Acquisition: With this core, things are usually â€œzero sum,â€‌ meaning thereâ€™s only so much to go around, and when itâ€™s gone, itâ€™s gone",GD
" Other times, itâ€™s a question of controlling a piece of territory, as it is in some first-person shooters",GD
" Games like Risk, Carcassonne, and many turn-based strategy games feature this core dynamic",GD
 Prediction: Some games are about doing the right thing or being in the right place at the right time,GD
" In many cases, these are childrenâ€™s games, although numerous carnival or party games also feature this core dynamic",GD
" All the individual mechanics in the game work toward allowing the players to guess what will happen, and they are rewarded for predicting the possible outcome of a game before it continues to the next round",GD
" Most times, the playerâ€™s prediction involves luck or consideration of odds",GD
 Games like Roulette or Rock-Paper-Scissors fit this core dynamic,GD
 Spatial Reasoning: Puzzle games often incorporate spatial-reasoning skills into video games,GD
" Games like Tetris make the player think not only of the piece that theyâ€™re putting in, but also the piece they may put in, or the piece that they desperately need to put in before the whole pile goes to pot",GD
" Many board games also make use of spatial skills, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Pente",GD
 The prototype for All Systems Down! (see Figure 1,GD
3) shows the use of spatial reasoning within a game,GD
" Survival: Human beings are naturally wired to survive and thrive, and itâ€™s no different in the game world",GD
 We will protect ourselves out of sheer instinct before weâ€™re even told the point of the game,GD
 Survival is a core within many games,GD
" However, itâ€™s important not to confuse a core with a lose condition in a game",GD
" In many video games, you can die, and if you do itâ€™s game over",GD
" Still, some of these games do not involve constant lifeor-death struggles as the primary activity of the game",GD
" If the player is concentrating on gaining power, killing enemies, or reaching the exit, then survival is a secondary activity that supports another core (such as building or destroying)",GD
" Destruction: The flip side of the survival dynamic, or the companion side if itâ€™s a player versus player (PvP) game, is the wreck-everything-in-sight dynamic",GD
" Every FPS ever made features this core dynamic, but it is also common in board and card games with a warfare theme, like Nuclear War, Plague and Pestilence, and Car Wars",GD
" Building: In addition to their drive to survive, human beings are also naturally wired to build, even though theyâ€™re not told that itâ€™s the point",GD
" In most RPGs, the core dynamic is character developmentâ€”building up the power level of a character",GD
" Video games in the so-called â€œcity builderâ€‌ genre, such as the SimCity and Caesar series, feature building as their core",GD
" In some board games, like Settlers of Catan, players spend most of their time developing their own resources",GD
" Collection: As humans, weâ€™re also natural pattern matchers",GD
" As humans, weâ€™re also natural pattern matchers",GD
 You just noticed those two sentences were identical and put them together without even consciously thinking about it,GD
" As a human, you canâ€™t help it",GD
 We match similar objects together instinctively,GD
" Collection features prominently in collectible card games (obviously), casual games (match three things together), platformers (collect rings, bolts, or gold coins), or games where getting the most of a resource determines the winner",GD
" Chasing or Evading: Ancient humans had to run a lot, either to capture prey or escape predators",GD
 So it should not be a surprise to see this dynamic in many games,GD
" It is prominent in most contact sports, as well as video games like Pac-Man and board games like Scotland Yard",GD
 Trading: Not all play is necessarily competitive,GD
" In many games, players cooperate with each other (even if they are opponents)",GD
" With games that have multiple kinds of resources that belong to each player, it is common to see players trading and negotiating with one another",GD
" Trading is a core dynamic of many non-digital games, such as Pit and Settlers of Catan",GD
 It happens outside of the game with collectible card games,GD
 Even video games like Animal Crossing and Pokemon feature the ability to trade with other players,GD
" Race to the End: Being the first to cross the street, the first to cross the finish line, or the first to learn a particular technology are each common uses of the â€œrace to the endâ€‌ core dynamic of gameplay (see Figure 1",GD
" Like survival, building, and collection, humans will also intuitively try to do things more quickly, in large part because the brain signals us that faster is better and is a sign of mastery over a given skill",GD
 Games featuring this mechanic are typically easy to create and play,GD
 The mechanic is often used in childrenâ€™s games,GD
 Anythingâ€”anything at allâ€”can be turned into a game,GD
" From bean farming, to sheep herding, to knitting, everything is fair game when it comes to game design",GD
" Nonetheless, for working game designers, the question â€œWhere do you get your ideas?â€‌ is a common one",GD
 There are multiple answers: Playing lots of games,GD
" Through playing games, you develop a vocabulary of mechanics and dynamics that are the necessary building blocks of successful game design",GD
" It is important to play many different kinds of games, not just those you are familiar with",GD
" Imagine if you were an architect and spent your entire life in a townhouse community, and then you tried to design a new house",GD
 That house would probably be similar to the ones you already know,GD
" Likewise, think of the level designer raised (for some odd reason) in an auditorium",GD
" All of his levels would reflect, in some way, the world that he grew up in",GD
" With exposure to lots of different games, however, your designs or the designs of your group are likely to reflect multiple influences (see Figure 1",GD
 Expose yourself to many new kinds of games to develop your range of knowledge and skills,GD
 Watch documentaries,GD
" If something interests you, look for the game inside",GD
 Networking with other designers,GD
 Two designers talking about the possibility inherent in a topic is a sure-fire way to produce a game,GD
" Mind you, it might be a bad game, so itâ€™s important to have a qualified pool of people to give you objective feedback as well",GD
" Still, designers share methods and always spur each other on to deeper thinking",GD
 Everywhere,GD
 Look for game ideas in everything you do and challenge yourself to make a game or think about making a game about a topic at least once a day,GD
" Right now around you, there are sounds you are completely tuning out: the flip of the page, the sound of your own breathing, and perhaps music or a television in the background",GD
 Game design can be tuned out or tuned in the same way,GD
" If you actively listen for the possibility and go with it, you will find game ideas everywhere",GD
 Game design is a field you must apply to learn,GD
" Truly, there is no substitute for making games",GD
" In that process, you learn so much more than you would by merely reading about making games",GD
" Fortunately, throughout the course of this book, youâ€™ll be doing a whole lot of that",GD
 Game design has been likened to cooking in this respect,GD
 Imagine a chef who only reads cookbooks or books on various techniques but never actually sets foot in a kitchen or tries to cook a meal,GD
 Odds are his first dishes will be terribly unappetizing,GD
 Or imagine a painter who has never picked up a brush,GD
" Beyond some initial study of basic concepts, the best way to get better at painting is to paint and then paint some more",GD
" Likewise, by creating and playing your own designs, you learn how particular mechanics work and donâ€™t work under a variety of circumstances",GD
" It is also only through the process of play that dynamics arise, and some of these may surprise you",GD
 In the prototype pictured in Figure 1,GD
"6, one of this bookâ€™s authors was attempting to simulate displacement for an installation that would appear as a part of an art exhibit",GD
" As play progressed, the gameplay developed two dynamics that the game designer didnâ€™t see coming",GD
 The first surprising dynamic was the change in the pace of play as one group of tokens crowded the others into a smaller and smaller piece of territory,GD
 Interesting strategies for â€œsurvivalâ€‌ developed where players would allow their tokens to get displaced more than once to ensure an optimum distance from the oncoming forces,GD
 The second surprising dynamic was the distinct phases that were present in the game play,GD
" Phases are to be expected in a gameâ€”Risk has very clear phasesâ€”but the designer was surprised by the clear delineation of phases in this game, too",GD
" By reading a rulebook or writing a design document, these dynamics would never have been evident",GD
" In order to design, you must practice design, and you must play what you practice",GD
 It doesnâ€™t work any other way,GD
 Feature List: A list that details key features or selling points of the game,GD
" In published games, these are typically found on the back of the box",GD
" Brainstorming: A process to generate ideas, usually done in a group",GD
" Generally, participants in a brainstorming session are instructed to call out any idea that occurs to them, no matter how strange, silly, or crazy it seems",GD
 One participant writes all of these ideas down on a space where everyone can see them,GD
" Participants may elaborate on or play off of othersâ€™ ideas, but criticism or elimination of ideas is not allowed until after the session is over",GD
 Prototype: A prototype is a playable early version of the game or part of the game constructed by the designer to assist in understanding and enhancing the player experience,GD
 It may be done with software (â€œdigital prototypeâ€‌) or with physical materials as a tabletop game (â€œphysical prototypeâ€‌ or â€œpaper prototypeâ€‌) Balance: A term used to describe the state of a gameâ€™s systems as either â€œbalancedâ€‌ or â€œunbalanced,GD
"â€‌ When the play is unbalanced, it is too easy, too difficult, or optimal for only certain groups of players",GD
" When play is balanced, it provides a consistent challenge for its target audience",GD
" For competitive multiplayer games, it also includes the idea that no single strategy should be inherently better than any other, and that no exploits exist that let a player bypass the challenge of the game",GD
" We also sometimes call individual game elements â€œbalancedâ€‌ with each other, meaning that the cost of obtaining it is proportional to its effect, as with cards in a CCG or weapons in an FPS or RPG",GD
 Mechanics: The rules of a game,GD
" Common non-digital mechanics include trick taking, turn taking, rolling a die, and moving",GD
" Examples of mechanics from video games are running, jumping, and shooting",GD
 Mechanics are covered extensively in Chapter 2,GD
" Dynamics: As popularized in Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubekâ€™s MDA (mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics) model,3 dynamics result when rules are put in motion",GD
" The rules that allow players to attack each other might be a mechanic, but players actually using these rules to team up against the player in the lead is a dynamic",GD
" In some first-person shooter games, players always begin in certain locations (â€œspawn pointsâ€‌), which is a mechanic; standing next to a spawn point and killing players that come out of it (â€œspawn campingâ€‌) is a dynamic",GD
" In Chess, the moves of the pieces are mechanics, but â€œbook openingsâ€‌ (well-known sequences of moves at the start of the game) are dynamics",GD
" System: A collection of game mechanics that is responsible for producing a given outcome within a larger game such as character creation, combat, or casting spells ",GD
Avatar: The direct representation of a player in a game,GD
" In Monopoly, the pieces moved around the board (shoe, dog, and so on) are avatars",GD
" In Tomb Raider, the main character Lara Croft is the avatar",GD
" In non-digital games, these are often called â€œtokens",GD
"â€‌ Playtesting: The systematic testing of gameplay, systems, balance, and interface to find all the errors, inconsistencies, or issues and report them to the design team",GD
" Platform: The console, device, or system upon which the game will be played",GD
 Concept Doc: A one- to three-page document that provides a high-level overview of a proposed game,GD
" It usually contains the following sections: an introductory paragraph explaining the theme of the game; demographic breakdown, including target audience, genre, and intended platform(s); and a bullet-point feature-list and a feature list breakout that explains each of the features in more detail",GD
 An outline for a sample concept doc is also provided on the bookâ€™s Web site at http://designgames,GD
wordpress,GD
com,GD
 Proposal: A five- to 20-page document that provides a more in-depth view of the potential game than a concept document,GD
" Like a concept document, it typically contains an introductory paragraph, a demographic breakdown, a gameplay summary, a feature list, and a feature-list breakout",GD
" It also contains budget and time estimations, competitive analysis (how it stacks up against the competition), and expansion plans (for example, sequels) beyond the initial product release",GD
" Typically, it contains screen mockups or concept art",GD
 An outline for a proposal doc is also provided on the book's Web site at http:// designgames,GD
wordpress,GD
 Pitch: A brief â€œelevator speechâ€‌ given to a game publisher or VC (venture capitalist) to solicit funding for the project,GD
 An elevator speech gets its name from the length of time that people have to present their ideasâ€”the amount of time youâ€™d spend riding with someone in an elevator before one of you had to get out,GD
" Design Document: A â€œlivingâ€‌ document that is continuously undergoing revision, it contains the entire design vision for the game",GD
 It may be in a document file or in a wiki,GD
" Some teams use Agile development, which requires no design document at all",GD
 More information on Agile can be found at AgileManifesto,GD
 Game design documents (GDDs) are usually separate from the technical design document (TDD) for programmers and the art style guide for the art team,GD
" Bugs: Errors in the gameâ€™s design, code, art, sound, or writing",GD
 Engine: The core program that runs the game,GD
 Unreal and Gamebryo are popular engines used in the game industry,GD
 Developers will layer additional technology on top of the engine to achieve the exact design specifications of the product,GD
 Alpha: The milestone at which all systems have been implemented and all code is theoretically complete,GD
" It is usually full of bugs, however, and not terribly balanced",GD
" Some companies also require that all contentâ€”art, sound, and narrativeâ€”be implemented for alpha, too",GD
" Therefore, alpha is content- and code-complete",GD
 Beta: The milestone at which all systems and content are in the game,GD
" It is significantly more stable than the alpha version, and many of the big bug and balancing issues have been addressed",GD
 Gold: The final version of the game that is then released,GD
 Game Jam: A timed period during which a group of individuals attempts to create a complete game while working around the clock,GD
 These events are usually 1â€“3 days in duration,GD
 Milestone: A point at which the developer is expected to deliver some type of predetermined content,GD
" It may be a document, numerous art assets, or a complete game",GD
" Non-digital games also have some common terms: Game Bits: The informal name given to the pieces and parts that ship with a game, including the game tiles, board, and cards (see Figure 1",GD
8),GD
 These are more formally called â€œcomponentsâ€‌ or â€œgame objects,GD
â€‌ Card Game: A game that uses playing cards,GD
" They may be a standard deck of cards, Pokemon cards, Magic: The Gathering cards, or other cards",GD
 Board Game: A game whose board serves as the playing field for the game,GD
" Tile Game: A type of game where the game â€œboardâ€‌ is made out of tiles, usually square or hexagonal (see Figure 1",GD
9),GD
" The tiles may start in a predetermined configuration (as in Settlers of Catan or Hey, Thatâ€™s My Fish!) or built during play (like Carcassonne)",GD
" Dice Game: A game that uses dice as the main bits, typically lacking a board, cards or tiles",GD
" Different designers have different approaches to game design, depending on the situation and the medium in which theyâ€™re designing",GD
" In creating the list that follows, certain liberties have been taken with the names",GD
" In other words, weâ€™ve made them up to describe processes that we both experience and regularly hear about",GD
" Blue-sky: Pure blue-sky design allows designers to consider lots of possibilities and ideas with a few exceptions imposed by time, money, interest, or all of the above",GD
" In some respects, game design is like treasure hunting without a map",GD
" Designers are always looking for new ideas, because the experience of creating a game right from the inception is inherently pleasurable to the designer",GD
" For most designers, in fact, the game lies in creating the game",GD
" Most of the time, a professional designer is working under a particular constraintâ€”an externally imposed restriction on the design",GD
" Bluesky design, however, assumes no constraints other than the designerâ€™s imagination",GD
" Slow boil: When given a theme and a settingâ€”say, the Irish in 1880s Bostonâ€”game designers begin what can only be described as a massive research mission, but one that often has little direction as long as it encompasses the theme",GD
" As one designer noted, â€œI stuff my head full of everything I can get on the topic, and then I wait",GD
 A design will emerge,GD
"â€‌ Fortunately for most designers, they are expert generalists with a love for learning and a natural curiosity that leads them in this direction",GD
" Sometimes, that design takes days, but other times, it may be weeks, months, or even years",GD
" Game designer Reiner Knizia regularly has 30 different designs on the go and has noted that he prefers to mull games over in his mind, playing them repeatedly, before moving to a prototype stage (see Figure 1",GD
10),GD
 One common mistake new designers make is forcing a game out too early or not giving it enough time to develop,GD
" Periodically writing down the ideas in oneâ€™s head can help spur still more ideas, particularly if the ideas take the form of a potential design document or rule set",GD
 Mechanic: Mechanic-driven design is more common than one might think,GD
 Consider the classic Super Mario Bros,GD
 game,GD
" Mario jumps onto things, over things, and into things",GD
" The strength of the game is based on the sheer strength of this mechanic, and nearly all games in the platformer genre have followed that gameâ€™s lead from long, long ago",GD
" Other more recent games, like those in the Katamari Damacy series, feature a mechanic in which a sticky ball rolls over something and picks it up",GD
" Again, that same mechanic is used over and over to great effect",GD
 Perhaps the largest mechanic-driven games feature the mechanic right in the genreâ€™s title: first-person shooters,GD
" The mechanic of firing a gun, a wand, or a something evidently never gets old",GD
 Even Mario could shoot fireballs,GD
" MDA: Using the mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics model of game development, designers create aesthetic models for various types of gameplay",GD
 Aesthetics donâ€™t refer to the looks of the game but rather the emotional response the designer and development team hope to evoke in the players through the game dynamics,GD
" If mechanics are the rules and dynamics are the play of the game, then aesthetics are typically the fun (or lack thereof) experienced by playing",GD
" Designers ask themselves which aesthetic they hope to achieve, define the dynamics that would lead to this feeling, and then create the mechanics to produce the desired dynamics",GD
 More information on MDA can be found at Marcâ€™s homepage at http://mahk,GD
8kindsoffun,GD
" IP: Standing for â€œintellectual property,â€‌ games based on IP are very common in the game industry, and most designers find themselves developing a game for a pre-existing IP at some point in their career",GD
 The term â€œIPâ€‌ is used to refer to pretty much anything or anyone upon whose likeness a game is built,GD
" Examples of IPs include Spiderman, Halo, The Sims, and individuals like John Madden",GD
 Even non-digital games are covered in IP,GD
" Most popular television shows release board-game versions, and popular video games are often made into card and board games",GD
 Pokemon and World of Warcraft are just two examples of game IP that have gone â€œoff the grid,GD
â€‌ Game publishers like to use IP because it mitigates risk,GD
" The more people who already know about it and like it, the larger the potential market based on the strength of the license alone, which means the Chapter 1 The Basics 17 FIGURE 1",GD
"10 Reiner Knizia, a prolific non-digital game designer",GD
 Over 200 of his games have been published as of the writing of this book,GD
 publisher has less risk of the game falling short of sales goals,GD
" As an example of the power of an IP, consider NFL football",GD
" Now, think of another professional football league",GD
" Though some have been tried in the real world and in video games, none ever came close to the strength of the true NFL",GD
" Story: Developing a game based on a story is also a common design approach, but more common in video games than non-digital games",GD
" This is often done hand-inhand with IP when the license holder wants the developer to stick closely to the story of the book, television show, or movie in question",GD
 The story can also represent the chronological timeline of a person or a company,GD
" Author Tom Clancy has licensed many of his books for games, and the epic The Lord of the Rings was turned into an acclaimed board game by Reiner Knizia",GD
" More often than not, however, in non-digital games, the designer takes a thematic approach as Knizia did",GD
" Research: Increasingly, games are being used to research a variety of topics or as the topic of research itself",GD
" For her MFA thesis, Savannah College of Art and Design student Michelle Menard created a production-grade board game, a documentary, and completed a research paper which explored the idea of using emotion to create game mechanics ",GD
" Likewise, USCâ€™s Jenova Chen created flOw to explore the concept of flow and dynamic difficulty adjustment in games",GD
"Walking over an object to pick it up is a phenomenally common mechanic in video games, and leads to the collection dynamic",GD
" There are, of course, other ways to collect something",GD
" Consider how collecting comes into play in the Mario games, Poker, or Bejeweled",GD
" For this exercise, youâ€™re going to take this mechanic and make a game out of it",GD
" This is slightly more challenging than starting with a dynamic, which, by itself, suggests both a beginning and an ending",GD
 You must create a game for two to four players in which players â€œwalkâ€‌ over objects and pick them up,GD
" What players need to collect (three of a kind, similar color, and so on) and how much they need to collect is up to you",GD
 Mechanics that modify the primary mechanic are acceptable,GD
" For instance, you could have players pick something up when they land on it, or have a wheelbarrow that they first must acquire in order to pick up the objects",GD
" You must choose the theme, components, and tokens, if applicable",GD
" You may also add additional mechanics, as needed",GD
" In particular, play attention to the narrative",GD
 It will help as you brainstorm,GD
" Think of this as a gardening game, then a gangster game, and then a carracing game",GD
 Each theme brings different possibilities into play ,GD
 The central premise of this book is that computer games constitute a new and as yet poorly developed art form that holds great promise for both designers and players,GD
 This premise may seem laughable or flippant,GD
" How could anybody classify the likes of SPACE INVADERS and PAC MAN as art? How can TEMPEST or MISSILE COMMAND compare with Beethovenâ€™s Fifth Symphony, Michelangeloâ€™s Pieta, or Hemingwayâ€™s A Farewell To Arms? Computer games are too trivial, too frivolous to be called art",GD
 They are idle recreation at best,GD
 So says the skeptic,GD
 But we cannot relegate computer games to the cesspit of pop culture solely on the evidence of the current crop of games,GD
 The industry is too young and the situation is too dynamic for us to dismiss computer games so easily,GD
" We must consider the potential, not the actuality",GD
 We must address the fundamental aspects of computer games to achieve a conclusion that will withstand the ravages of time and change,GD
" There are many definitions of art, few of which make much sense to the uninitiated",GD
 I will present my own pedestrian definition: art is something designed to evoke emotion through fantasy,GD
" The artist presents his audience with a set of sensory experiences that stimulates commonly shared fantasies, and so generates emotions",GD
 Art is made possible only by the richness of the fantasy world we share,GD
" Art is nevertheless difficult, because there are so many practical problems associated with stimulating fantasies deep inside another personâ€™s mind",GD
 A The Art of Computer Game Design  major problem is getting the attention or participation of the audience,GD
 Most art allows very little participation,GD
" You sit quietly and listen to music that other people created and perform, or you stroll through a museum and stare at pictures or statues other people made",GD
" You sit passively and read a novel, or a poem, or a short story",GD
" With all of these art forms, the role of the audience is passive",GD
" The artist does all the active work, makes the biggest emotional investment",GD
 The audience is expected to absorb quietly the fruits of the artistâ€™s exertions,GD
 Active participation is severely curtailed,GD
" Without participation, attention dwindles and impact crumbles away",GD
 This is in no wise a criticism of art or artists,GD
 The technologies of art preclude participation,GD
" If we had every klutz jump into the orchestra pit, or prance on the opera stage, or slop paint with Picasso, we would have some great parties but no art",GD
 it seems the curse of art that artists can say so much in their work and most people will hear so little because they cannot participate in the art,GD
 Enter the computer,GD
" Conceived long ago, born in war, reared as the servant of business, this now adolescent technology has exploded out of the computer room and invaded shopping centers, pizza parlors, and homes",GD
" Popular characterizations of the computer alternate between the old image of the computer as omniscient, cold blooded, giant calculator, and the new image of the computer as purveyor of video thrills and 25 cent fixes",GD
" Originally developed as a number cruncher, the computer assumed a new personality when it was given graphics and sound capabilities",GD
" These capabilities gave the computer a powerful asset: it could now communicate with the human, not just in the cold and distant language of digits, but in the emotionally immediate and compelling language of images and sounds",GD
" With this capability came a new, previously undreamed of possibility: the possibility of using the computer as a medium for emotional communication art",GD
 The computer game has emerged as the prime vehicle for this medium,GD
 The computer game is an art form because it presents its audience with fantasy experiences that stimulate emotion,GD
" Unfortunately, the current generation of microcomputers cannot produce a sensory experience as rich as that produced by, say, a symphony orchestra or a movie",GD
 This weakness is more than offset by a fundamental advantage lacking in most other art forms: a game is intrinsically participatory in nature,GD
 The artist has here a tool that is more subtly indirect than traditional art,GD
" With other art forms, the artist directly creates the experience that the audience will encounter",GD
" Since this experience is carefully planned and executed, the audience must somehow be prevented from disturbing it; hence, non participation",GD
" With a game, the artist creates not the experience itself but the conditions and rules under which the audience will create its own individualized experience",GD
" The demand on the artist is greater, for s/he must plan the experience indirectly, taking into account the probable and possible actions and reactions of the audience",GD
" The return is far greater, for participation increases attention and heightens the intensity of the experience",GD
" When we passively observe someone elseâ€™s artistic presentation, we derive some emotional benefit, but when we actively participate in a game, we invest a portion of our own ego into the fantasy world of the game",GD
 This more sizable investment of participation yields a commensurately greater return of emotional satisfaction,GD
" Indeed, the role of participation is so important that many people derive greater satisfaction from participating in an amateur artistic effort than from observing a professional effort",GD
" Hence, games, being intrinsically participatory, present the artist with a fantastic opportunity for reaching people",GD
 Another contributor to the fecklessness of our current computer games is the timidity of the marketplace,GD
 These machines are new; the public is unfamiliar with them and the manufacturers are hesitant to press the public too hard too fast,GD
 We therefore opt to build inhibited little games pathetically whispering some trivial emotion,GD
" Truly intense emotions or situations such as pathos, ecstasy, majesty, rapture, catharsis, or tragedy intimidate use",GD
" We hide behind the defense that we are in the entertainment business, not the art business, but that defense only betrays a profound misunderstanding of art",GD
" Art can be starchily elitist, but good art can also be a foot stomping blast",GD
 Elitism arises from the intellectual content of art; impact springs from its emotional honesty,GD
" Fortunately, times are changing",GD
" Already, we see a backlash developing against computer games",GD
" It expresses itself in many ways: in ordinances against the placement of arcade games in some areas, in statements by educators denouncing the games, and in more vigilant regulation of childrenâ€™s game activities by parents",GD
 This backlash is viewed by smaller minded members of the industry with anxiety,GD
 More visionary thinkers watch the backlash with eager interest rather than defensiveness,GD
" The American people are telling us something here, something very important",GD
 It is imporant enough to them that they are willing to compromise their traditional reluctance to interfere with other peopleâ€™s business,GD
" While the arguments presented in public debates normally focus on formal issues such as delinquency from school, creation of large groups of rowdy teenagers, and so forth, the concerns expressed privately reflect a distaste for the games, a vague suspicion that the games are a waste of time",GD
 You canâ€™t fool all of the people all of the time; they are beginning to realize that the world of computer games is as yet a vast wasteland,GD
" Computer games are much like candy, comic books, and cartoons",GD
 All four activities provide intense or exaggerated experiences,GD
" Whether they use sugar, exclamation points, or animated explosions, the goal is the same: to provide extreme experiences",GD
 Children appreciate these activities because their novelty value is still strong,GD
" Adults, jaded by years of experience with such things, prefer diversions with greater subtlety and depth",GD
" We thus have the panoply of culinary achievement, the vast array of literature, and the universe of movies as the adult counterparts to candy, comic books, and cartoons",GD
" Yet, we have no adult counterpart to computer games",GD
" This deficit is pregnant with possibilities, for it suggests a momentous upheaval in computer game design",GD
 This developing revolution has nothing to do with the rapid technological developments of the last few years,GD
" While technological improvements will surely continue, we are no longer hampered primarily by the limitations of the hardware",GD
 Our primary problem is that we have little theory on which to base our efforts,GD
" We donâ€™t really know what a game is, or why people play games, or what makes a game great",GD
" Real art through computer games is achievable, but it will never be achieved so long as we have no path to understanding",GD
" We need to establish our principles of aesthetics, a framework for criticism, and a model for development",GD
" New and better hardware will improve our games, but it will not guarantee our artistic success any more than the development of orchestras guaranteed the appearance of Beethoven",GD
 We are a long way from a computer game comparable to a Shakespeare play,GD
Information security (sometimes referred to as InfoSec) covers the tools and processes that organizations use to protect information,IS
 This includes policy settings that prevent unauthorized people from accessing business or personal information,IS
" InfoSec is a growing and evolving field that covers a wide range of fields, from network and infrastructure security to testing and auditing",IS
"Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including inspection, modification, recording, and any disruption or destruction",IS
" The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data such as customer account details, financial data or intellectual property",IS
"The consequences of security incidents include theft of private information, data tampering, and data deletion",IS
" Attacks can disrupt work processes and damage a companyâ€™s reputation, and also have a tangible cost",IS
"Organizations must allocate funds for security and ensure that they are ready to detect, respond to, and proactively prevent, attacks such as phishing, malware, viruses, malicious insiders, and ransomware",IS
What are the 3 Principles of Information Security?,IS
"The basic tenets of information security are confidentiality, integrity and availability",IS
 Every element of the information security program must be designed to implement one or more of these principles,IS
 Together they are called the CIA Triad,IS
Confidentiality,IS
Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information,IS
 The purpose of the confidentiality principle is to keep personal information private and to ensure that it is visible and accessible only to those individuals who own it or need it to perform their organizational functions,IS
Integrity,IS
"Consistency includes protection against unauthorized changes (additions, deletions, alterations, etc",IS
) to data,IS
" The principle of integrity ensures that data is accurate and reliable and is not modified incorrectly, whether accidentally or maliciously",IS
Availability,IS
Availability is the protection of a systemâ€™s ability to make software systems and data fully available when a user needs it (or at a specified time),IS
" The purpose of availability is to make the technology infrastructure, the applications and the data available when they are needed for an organizational process or for an organizationâ€™s customers",IS
Information Security vs Cybersecurity,IS
Information security differs from cybersecurity in both scope and purpose,IS
" The two terms are often used interchangeably, but more accurately, cybersecurity is a subcategory of information security",IS
" Information security is a broad field that covers many areas such as physical security, endpoint security, data encryption, and network security",IS
" It is also closely related to information assurance, which protects information from threats such as natural disasters and server failures",IS
"Cybersecurity primarily addresses technology-related threats, with practices and tools that can prevent or mitigate them",IS
" Another related category is data security, which focuses on protecting an organizationâ€™s data from accidental or malicious exposure to unauthorized parties",IS
Information Security Policy,IS
An Information Security Policy (ISP) is a set of rules that guide individuals when using IT assets,IS
 Companies can create information security policies to ensure that employees and other users follow security protocols and procedures,IS
 Security policies are intended to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive systems and information,IS
Creating an effective security policy and taking steps to ensure compliance is an important step towards preventing and mitigating security threats,IS
" To make your policy truly effective, update it frequently based on company changes, new threats, conclusions drawn from previous breaches, and changes to security systems and tools",IS
Make your information security strategy practical and reasonable,IS
" To meet the needs and urgency of different departments within the organization, it is necessary to deploy a system of exceptions, with an approval process, enabling departments or individuals to deviate from the rules in specific circumstances",IS
Top Information Security Threats,IS
There are hundreds of categories of information security threats and millions of known threat vectors,IS
 Below we cover some of the key threats that are a priority for security teams at modern enterprises,IS
Unsecure or Poorly Secured Systems,IS
The speed and technological development often leads to compromises in security measures,IS
" In other cases, systems are developed without security in mind, and remain in operation at an organization as legacy systems",IS
" Organizations must identify these poorly secured systems, and mitigate the threat by securing or patching them, decommissioning them, or isolating them",IS
Social Media Attacks,IS
"Many people have social media accounts, where they often unintentionally share a lot of information about themselves",IS
" Attackers can launch attacks directly via social media, for example by spreading malware via social media messages, or indirectly, by using information obtained from these sites to analyze user and organizational vulnerabilities, and use them to design an attack",IS
Social Engineering,IS
Social engineering involves attackers sending emails and messages that trick users into performing actions that may compromise their security or divulge private information,IS
" Attackers manipulate users using psychological triggers like curiosity, urgency or fear",IS
"Because the source of a social engineering message appears to be trusted, people are more likely to comply, for example by clicking a link that installs malware on their device, or by providing personal information, credentials, or financial details",IS
Organizations can mitigate social engineering by making users aware of its dangers and training them to identify and avoid suspected social engineering messages,IS
" In addition, technological systems can be used to block social engineering at its source, or prevent users from performing dangerous actions such as clicking on unknown links or downloading unknown attachments",IS
"Organizational users work with a large variety of endpoint devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, many of which are privately owned and not under the organizationâ€™s control, and all of which connect regularly to the Internet",IS
"A primary threat on all these endpoints is malware, which can be transmitted by a variety of means, can result in compromise of the endpoint itself, and can also lead to privilege escalation to other organizational systems",IS
"Traditional antivirus software is insufficient to block all modern forms of malware, and more advanced approaches are developing to securing endpoints, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR)",IS
Encryption processes encode data so that it can only be decoded by users with secret keys,IS
" It is very effective in preventing data loss or corruption in case of equipment loss or theft, or in case organizational systems are compromised by attackers",IS
"Unfortunately, this measure is often overlooked due to its complexity and lack of legal obligations associated with proper implementation",IS
" Organizations are increasingly adopting encryption, by purchasing storage devices or using cloud services that support encryption, or using dedicated security tools",IS
Security Misconfiguration,IS
"Modern organizations use a huge number of technological platforms and tools, in particular web applications, databases, and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) from providers like Amazon Web Services",IS
"Enterprise grade platforms and cloud services have security features, but these must be configured by the organization",IS
 Security misconfiguration due to negligence or human error can result in a security breach,IS
" Another problem is â€œconfiguration driftâ€‌, where correct security configuration can quickly become out of date and make a system vulnerable, unbeknownst to IT or security staff",IS
"Organizations can mitigate security misconfiguration using technological platforms that continuously monitor systems, identify configuration gaps, and alert or even automatically remediate configuration issues that make systems vulnerable",IS
Active vs Passive Attacks,IS
Information security is intended to protect organizations against malicious attacks,IS
 There are two primary types of attacks: active and passive,IS
" Active attacks are considered more difficult to prevent, and the focus is on detecting, mitigating and recovering from them",IS
 Passive attacks are easier to prevent with strong security measures,IS
Active Attack,IS
An active attack involves intercepting a communication or message and altering it for malicious effect,IS
 There are three common variants of an active attacks,IS
"Interruptionâ€”the attacker interrupts the original communication and creates new, malicious messages, pretending to be one of the communicating parties",IS
"Modificationâ€”the attacker uses existing communications, and either replays them to fool one of the communicating parties, or modifies them to gain an advantage",IS
"Fabricationâ€”creates fake, or synthetic, communications, typically with the aim of achieving denial of service (DoS)",IS
 This prevents users from accessing systems or performing normal operations,IS
Information security is in constant interaction with the laws and regulations of the places where an organization does business,IS
" Data protection regulations around the world focus on enhancing the privacy of personal data, and place restrictions on the way organizations can collect, store, and make use of customer data",IS
"Data privacy focuses on personally identifiable information (PII), and is primarily concerned with how the data is stored and used",IS
" PII includes any data that can be linked directly to the user, such as name, ID number, date of birth, physical address, or phone number",IS
" It may also include artifacts like social media posts, profile pictures and IP addresses",IS
Data Protection Laws in the European Union (EU): the GDPRThe most known privacy law in the EU is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),IS
" This regulation covers the collection, use, storage, security and transmission of data related to EU residents",IS
"The GDPR applies to any organization doing business with EU citizens, regardless of whether the company itself is based inside or outside the European Union",IS
 Violation of the guidelines may result in fines of up to 4% of global sales or 20 million Euro,IS
The main goals of the GDPR are,IS
Setting the privacy of personal data as a basic human right,IS
Implementing privacy criteria requirements,IS
Standardization of how privacy rules are applied,IS
GDPR includes protection of the following data types:,IS
"Personal information such as name, ID number, date of birth, or address",IS
"Web data such as IP address, cookies, location, etc",IS
Health information including diagnosis and prognosis,IS
"Biometric data including voice data, DNA, and fingerprints",IS
Private communications,IS
Photos and videos,IS
"Cultural, social or economic data",IS
Data Protection Laws in the USA,IS
"Despite the introduction of some regulations, there are currently no federal laws governing data privacy in general in the United States",IS
" However, some regulations protect certain types or use of data",IS
 These include,IS
"Federal Trade Commission Actâ€”prohibits organizations from deceiving consumers with regard to privacy policies, failure to adequately protect customer privacy, and misleading advertising",IS
Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Actâ€”regulates the collection of data related to minors,IS
"Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA)â€”regulates the storage, privacy and use of health information",IS
Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA)â€”regulates personal information collected and stored by financial institutions and banks,IS
"Fair Credit Reporting Actâ€”regulates the collection, use, and accessibility of credit records and information",IS
"Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for protecting users from fraudulent or unfair transactions such as data security and privacy",IS
" The FTC can enact regulations, enforce laws, punish violations, and investigate organizational fraud or suspected violations",IS
"In addition to federal guidelines, 25 US states have enacted various laws to regulate data",IS
 The most famous example is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),IS
" The law went into effect in January 2020 and provides protection to California residents, including the right to access private information, request deletion of private information, and opt out of data collection or resale",IS
Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) CPS 234,IS

 Encryption,IS
TLS/SSL can help to secure transmitted data using encryption,IS
Interoperability,IS
" TLS/SSL works with most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer and on most operating systems and web servers",IS
Algorithm flexibility,IS
"TLS/SSL provides operations for authentication mechanism, encryption algorithms and hashing algorithm that are used during the secure session",IS
Ease of Deployment,IS
Many applications TLS/SSL temporarily on a windows server 2003 operating systems,IS
Ease of Use,IS
"Because we implement TLS/SSL beneath the application layer, most of its operations are completely invisible to client",IS
 Working of TLS,IS
" The client connect to server (using TCP), the client will be something",IS
 The client sends number of specification,IS
Version of SSL/TLS,IS
"which cipher suites, compression method it wants to use",IS
" The server checks what the highest SSL/TLS version is that is supported by them both, picks a cipher suite from one of the clients option (if it supports one) and optionally picks a compression method",IS
" After this the basic setup is done, the server provides its certificate",IS
 This certificate must be trusted either by the client itself or a party that the client trusts,IS
" Having verified the certificate and being certain this server really is who he claims to be (and not a man in the middle), a key is exchanged",IS
" This can be a public key, â€œPreMasterSecretâ€‌ or simply nothing depending upon cipher suite",IS
 Both the server and client can now compute the key for symmetric encryption,IS
 The handshake is finished and the two hosts can communicate securely,IS
 To close a connection by finishing,IS
 TCP connection both sides will know the connection was improperly terminated,IS
" The connection cannot be compromised by this through, merely interrupted",IS

What is the difference between cybersecurity and information security?,IS
Information security and cybersecurity are often confused,IS
" InfoSec is a crucial part of cybersecurity, but it refers exclusively to the processes designed for data security",IS
 Cybersecurity is a more general term that includes InfoSec,IS
What is an information security management system (ISMS)?,IS
An ISMS is a set of guidelines and processes created to help organizations in a data breach scenario,IS
" By having a formal set of guidelines, businesses can minimize risk and can ensure work continuity in case of a staff change",IS
 ISO 27001 is a well-nown specification for a company ISMS,IS
What is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?,IS
"In 2016, the European Parliament and Council agreed on the General Data Protection Regulation",IS
" In the spring of 2018, the GDPR began requiring companies ",IS
provide data breach notifications,IS
appoint a data-protection officer,IS
require user consent for data processing,IS
anonymize data for privacy,IS
Information security or infosec is concerned with protecting information from unauthorized access,IS
" It's part of information risk management and involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspect, or recording",IS
"If a security incident does occur, information security professionals are involved with reducing the negative impact of the incident",IS
" Note information can be electronic or physical, tangible or intangible",IS
"While the primary focus of any information security program is protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability (the CIA triad) of information, maintaining organizational productivity is often an important consideration",IS
This has led the information security industry to specific best-practice standards in the following areas:Information security policies,IS
Password strength,IS
Access controls,IS
Multi-factor authentication,IS
"Antivirus software, firewalls",IS
Cryptography,IS
Legal liability,IS
Security awareness,IS
Information security is achieved through a structured risk management process ,IS
"Identifies information, related assets and the threats, vulnerability and impact of unauthorized access",IS
Evaluates risks,IS
Makes decisions about how to address or treat risks i,IS
" avoid, mitigate, share or accept",IS
"When mitigated, selects, designs and implements security controls",IS
"Monitors activities and makes adjustments to address any new issues, changes, or improvements",IS
Who Manages InformationSecurity?,IS
"Threats to information security come in many forms including natural disasters, server malfunction, physical theft and unpatched endpoints",IS
"While paper-based businesses still exist, the ever-increasing reliance on information systems has cause information security to become a key consideration in cybersecurity risk management and raise a need for dedicated IT security specialists",IS
"These information technology security professionals are concerned with data security, application security, network security, computer security, physical security and data loss prevention",IS
"Understand that data, applications, and computers are spreading far beyond what is traditionally thought of as a computer",IS
" Smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices are as much of a computer as a server or mainframe and are susceptible to malicious cyber attacks that can facilitate access to sensitive information, critical information, or information assets",IS
"This, paired with the increasing amount of data breaches, has led for increased demand for sophisticated data protection planning and growing demand for cybersecurity professionals (especially in healthcare) to understand information security",IS
A growing number of information security certifications are available and employers often prefer employees with certification that validates knowledge of best practices,IS
"There are broad certifications like the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), and specific ones that cover information assurance, network security, security testing, business auditing, business continuity planning, security testing, incident response planning, identity theft, risk assessments, intrusion detection systems, security breaches, and all other security measures",IS
"Common roles that required expertise in information management include IT chief security officer (CSO), chief information security officer (CISO), security engineer, information security analyst, security systems administrator and IT security consultant",IS
What are Information ,IS
"What are Information Security Threats?Threats cn come in many forms including software attacks, identity theft, sabotage, physical theft and information extortion:",IS
"Software attacks on information security include viruses, malware, worms, ransomware like WannaCry, trojan horses or any malicious codes that impact the availability of information",IS
Phishing emails or websites are often aimed at stealing intellectual property or log-in credentials to gain unauthorized access,IS
 Social engineering is one of the largest cyber threats and is hard to protect against with traditional security measures,IS
"Sabotage like denial of service attacks often aim to reduce the availability of key information assets, reducing confidence or organizational productivity until payment is received in exchange for returning service to the organization",IS
Theft of information and equipment is becoming increasingly common as most devices are now mobile in nature like smartphones or laptops,IS
 This is placing more dependance on cloud security than ever before in history,IS
Information extortion involves gaining access to confidential information and then holding it at ransom until payment is madeThere are many ways to protect against cyber attacks but the number one threat to any organization are its users or internal employees who are susceptible to social engineering or phishing,IS
 This is why cybersecurity awareness training should be integrated into information security management programs,IS
What is a cyber threat?,IS
What is a data breach?,IS
What is social engineering?,IS
What are phishing attacks?,IS
What is clickjacking?,IS
What is typosquatting?,IS
What is a DDoS attack?,IS
What is Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)?,IS
How Do You Respond to Information Security Threats?,IS
Reduce or mitigate the risk by implementing safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce threats and vulnerabilities,IS
Assign or transfer the risk to another entity or organization by purchasing insurance or outsourcing,IS
Accept the risk when the cost of the countermeasure is more than the possible cost of loss due to a vulnerability or cyber attack,IS
"With the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Parliament and Council in 2016, the need to respond to information security breaches has become a regulatory requirement for any business operating within the EU",IS

How Do You Define Information Security?,IS
"There are many ways to define information security but both the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary define information security as ""the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability",IS
"What are the Key Principles of Information Security?., also known as the CIA triad, are at the heart of information security. That said, there is a debate about whether or not the CIA triad sufficiently addresses the rapidly changing technology and business requirements, as well as the relationship between security and privacy. Other principles such as accountability have been proposed and non-repudiation does not fit in well with the three core concepts.What is Confidentiality?.Confidentiality is about not making information available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes. While similar to privacy the words should not be used interchangeably.Confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements security measures to protect against unauthorized viewers. User privacy has become an increasing part of confidentiality due to GDPR and other regulatory requirements.Other examples of confidentiality include protection from laptop theft, password theft and other security management techniques.What is Integrity?.Integrity or data integrity is concerned with the maintenance, assurance, accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means implementing security controls that ensure data cannot be modified or deleted by an unauthorized person or in an undetected manner.What is Availability?.For any information system to be useful, it must be available when needed. This means computer systems that store and process information, the security controls that protect it, and the communication channels that access it must function on demand.Businesses and their customers increasingly rely on real-time high availability systems 24/7. This means information security professionals are increasingly concerned with ensuring availability by preventing power outages, hardware failure and denial of service attacks. Availability is often viewed as the most important part of a successful information security program as its ultimately the end-users who need to be able to use the information.What is Non-Repudiation?.Non-repudiation is a term borrowed from law that implies one's intention to fulfil their obligations in a contract and that one party cannot deny having received or having sent a transaction.How Does Information Security Fit in With Information Risk Management?.Information risk management is the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to information resources used by an organization and what if any countermeasures should be taken to reduce risk to an acceptable level based on the value of the information value to the organization.There are two main considerations with any risk management process:The process of risk management is ongoing and iterative in nature, it must be repeated indefinitely as new threats and vulnerabilities emergeThe choice of countermeasures or controls used must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness, and the information value of the asset being protectedRisk analysis and evaluation have innate limitations because when security incidents occur, they emerge in context and can come from unpredictable or unexpected threats like poorly configured S3 buckets or external attackers.The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates risk. In the context of information security, the impact is loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability or all other possible losses (e.g reputational and financial damages). Note: It's not possible to identify nor mitigate all risks. This remaining risk is called residual risk.What is a Threat?.A threat is anything (incidental or deliberate) that could cause potential harm, loss or exposure to an information asset.What is a Vulnerability?.A vulnerability is a weakness or exploit that could cause harm, loss or exposure to an information assetWhat is Risk?.Risk is the likelihood that an event could cause harm, loss or exposure to an information asset.What is a Risk Assessment?.Cyber risk assessments are defined by NIST as risks assessments are used to identify, estimate, and prioritize risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation and use of information systems.At a high level a cyber risk assessment involves a data audit that answers.What data do we collect?.How and where are we storing this data?.Who has access internally and externally to the data?.Is the place we are storing the data properly secured? Many breaches come from poorly configured S3 buckets,.What is the purpose of the assessment?.What is the scope of the assessment?.Are there any priorities or constraints I should be aware of that could affect the assessment?.Who do I need access to in the organization to get all the information I need?.What risk model does the organization use for risk analysis?.,",IS

"Security Operation Centers (SOCs) are being operated by universities, government agencies, and corporations to defend their enterprise networks in general and in particular to identify malicious behaviors in both networks and hosts",IS
" The success of a SOC depends on having the right tools, processes and, most importantly, efficient and effective analysts",IS
 One of the worrying issues in recent times has been the consistently high burnout rates of security analysts in SOCs,IS
 Burnout results in analysts making poor judgments when analyzing security events as well as frequent personnel turnovers,IS
" In spite of high awareness of this problem, little has been known so far about the factors leading to burnout",IS
 Various coping strategies employed by SOC management such as career progression do not seem to address the problem but rather deal only with the symptoms,IS
" In short, burnout is a manifestation of one or more underlying issues in SOCs that are as of yet unknown",IS
 In this work we performed an anthropological study of a corporate SOC over a period of six months and identified concrete factors contributing to the burnout phenomenon,IS
 We use Grounded Theory to analyze our fieldwork data and propose a model that explains the burnout phenomenon,IS
" Our model indicates that burnout is a human capital management problem resulting from the cyclic interaction of a number of human, technical, and managerial factors",IS
" Specifically, we identified multiple vicious cycles connecting the factors affecting the morale of the analysts",IS
 In this paper we provide detailed descriptions of the various vicious cycles and suggest ways to turn these cycles into virtuous ones,IS
 We further validated our results on the fieldnotes from a SOC at a higher education institution,IS
 The proposed model is able to successfully capture and explain the burnout symptoms in this other SOC as well,IS
" With an increase in cyber threats, corporations and government agencies alike are establishing dedicated monitoring stations called security operation centers (SOCs)",IS
 An organization can decide to build its own SOC or outsource the monitoring to managed operational service providers,IS
" The key component of any SOC, in-house or managed, is training and staffing of security analysts",IS
" Although tools and processes improve the efficiency of operations, it is the security analysts who make the final decision when analyzing a threat",IS
 Hence it is imperative for a SOC to spend adequate resources in developing and maintaining an effective team of security analysts,IS
 In our work we wanted to find answer to an important question â€” How to maintain a capable and enthusiastic analyst workforce? The problem bears considerable similarity to the human capital model in economics,IS
" The Human Capital theory [13], first postulated by Adam Smith, holds that the investment made in education and training of individuals in a society is a resource in itself, more important than capital and natural resources",IS
 Security analysts are the human capital of a SOC and proper investment in their continuous improvement is key for efficient operation,IS
 Unfortunately SOCs have been plagued by high analyst turnover due to burnout [10],IS
" Burnout refers to diminished interest in work and is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy [9]",IS
 Burnout in SOCs usually results in a high analyst turnover leading to frequent hiring and training of new analysts,IS
 A white paper from Hewlett-Packard (HP) [7] points out that the life-time of a security analyst is between 1-3 years,IS
" Moreover, the volatile nature also makes it hard for analysts to know each other well, thus affecting team camaraderie, which eventually affects how the entire team responds to security incidents",IS
" In spite of the burnout problem being well recognized, little to nothing is known about the concrete factors that cause the burnout",IS
" If the real reasons behind this issue are not identified, we will be only addressing the symptoms and not the actual problem",IS
 In order to understand challenges in a SOC environment we first had to find a way to interact with the SOC analysts,IS
 The fieldworkers and the SOC analysts who were observed can be considered human subjects,IS
" Prior to starting the formal fieldwork, we obtained the appropriate IRB approvals",IS
 All participants were asked to sign an â€œinformed consent formâ€‌ approving of their participation in our research,IS
" The consent form explained clearly to the participants the goal of our research, what we expected from them, and how the fieldwork data will be used",IS
 We took efforts to protect the privacy of the participants such as by not using real names of analysts during research discussions and also by not revealing opinions of one analyst to another,IS
 We also followed the standard practice in anthropology where the fieldnotes are accessible only to the fieldworker who writes them,IS
 We can safely say that our research did not raise any ethical concerns for the participants,IS
 The organizational layout of the SOC is shown in Figure 1,IS
 There were two different teams within the SOC: (1) operations; (2) incident management (IM),IS
 The operations team analysts were divided into two categories: Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2),IS
 The L1 analysts work four days a week in 10 hour shifts while the L2 analysts work 5 days a week in 8 hour shifts,IS
 L1 analysts are the first line of defense monitoring the Security Information Event Management (SIEM) console for any possible (attempted) security breaches,IS
 The L2 analysts play more of a managerial and mentoring role for the L1 analysts,IS
 Their main job is to provide operational visibility for higher management through metrics and reports,IS
 At the time of our fieldwork there were 2 L2 and 18 L1 analysts in the operations team headed by an Operations Manager,IS
 The IM team consisted of six analysts led by a manager,IS
 Of the six analysts two were off-site working remotely,IS
 The IM team handles incidents that are escalated from the operations team requiring in-depth analysis,IS
 The fieldworker spent three months as an L1 analyst in the operations team and the remaining three months as an incident responder in the IM team,IS

" InfoSec is a growing and evolving field that covers a wide range of fields, from network and infrastructure security to testing and auditing",IS
"Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including inspection, modification, recording, and any disruption or destruction",IS
" The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data such as customer account details, financial data or intellectual property",IS
"The consequences of security incidents include theft of private information, data tampering, and data deletion",IS
" Attacks can disrupt work processes and damage a companyâ€™s reputation, and also have a tangible cost",IS
"Organizations must allocate funds for security and ensure that they are ready to detect, respond to, and proactively prevent, attacks such as phishing, malware, viruses, malicious insiders, and ransomware",IS
What are the 3 Principles of Information Security?,IS
"The basic tenets of information security are confidentiality, integrity and availability",IS
 Every element of the information security program must be designed to implement one or more of these principles,IS
 Together they are called the CIA Triad,IS
Confidentiality,IS
Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information,IS
 The purpose of the confidentiality principle is to keep personal information private and to ensure that it is visible and accessible only to those individuals who own it or need it to perform their organizational functions,IS
Integrity,IS
"Consistency includes protection against unauthorized changes (additions, deletions, alterations, etc",IS
Security analysts are among the most important information intermediaries in capital markets,IS
" They produce reports that contain earnings forecasts, investment recommendations and target prices, through which they reveal important information to other market participants",IS

"Most security analysts work full time but oftentimes work more than 40 hours, especially when there is a breach in security at their company",IS
 With the increase of technology use there is faster than average growth in this occupational field especially for those wanting to work in medical and government agencies,IS
Security Analyst Career Video Transcript,IS
"As persistently as computer hackers work to infiltrate secure networks, information security analysts work that much harder to keep prying eyes out",IS
 Information security analysts design and implement security measures to protect an organizationâ€™s computer networks and systems,IS
 Their creativity and innovation continually expand as the number and complexity of cyberattacks increases,IS
" In this field, itâ€™s essential to keep up with new technology and preventive methods",IS
"Information security analysts install and operate firewalls, data encryption programs, and other software, monitor their organization for security breaches, and even simulate attacks to look for vulnerabilities in their system",IS
 Their work is the opposite of hackingâ€” and security analysts need to know how to break a systemâ€™s defensesâ€¦ just as well as they know how to build them,IS
" Information security analysts work for computer companies, consulting firms, or business and financial companies",IS
Most work standard full-time hours but may need to be on call in case of an emergency,IS
" Information security analysts typically need at least a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, programming, or a related field, though some employers prefer applicants with a Masterâ€™s of Business Administration in Information Systems",IS
" As the field of information security quickly evolves, new specialized education and training programs are emerging, but having an ingenious streak will continue to be a vital quality for these professionals",IS

What is a Network?,NT
"A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications",NT
" The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams",NT
"You may also see references to a Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), a Wireless LAN (WLAN), or a Wireless WAN (WWAN)",NT
Local Area Network,NT
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area,NT
" It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building",NT
Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or workstations,NT
" Servers are generally not used by humans directly, but rather run continuously to provide ""services"" to the other computers (and their human users) on the network",NT
" Services provided can include printing and faxing, software hosting, file storage and sharing, messaging, data storage and retrieval, complete access control (security) for the network's resources, and many others",NT
Workstations are called such because they typically do have a human user which interacts with the network through them,NT
" Workstations were traditionally considered a desktop, consisting of a computer, keyboard, display, and mouse, or a laptop, with with integrated keyboard, display, and touchpad",NT
" With the advent of the tablet computer, and the touch screen devices such as iPad and iPhone, our definition of workstation is quickly evolving to include those devices, because of their ability to interact with the network and utilize network services",NT
"Servers tend to be more powerful than workstations, although configurations are guided by needs",NT
" For example, a group of servers might be located in a secure area, away from humans, and only accessed through the network",NT
" In such cases, it would be common for the servers to operate without a dedicated display or keyboard",NT
" However, the size and speed of the server's processor(s), hard drive, and main memory might add dramatically to the cost of the system",NT
" On the other hand, a workstation might not need as much storage or working memory, but might require an expensive display to accommodate the needs of its user",NT
 Every computer on a network should be appropriately configured for its use,NT
"On a single LAN, computers and servers may be connected by cables or wirelessly",NT
 Wireless access to a wired network is made possible by wireless access points (WAPs),NT
 These WAP devices provide a bridge between computers and networks,NT
" A typical WAP might have the theoretical capacity to connect hundreds or even thousands of wireless users to a network, although practical capacity might be far less",NT
"Nearly always servers will be connected by cables to the network, because the cable connections remain the fastest",NT
" Workstations which are stationary (desktops) are also usually connected by a cable to the network, although the cost of wireless adapters has dropped to the point that, when installing workstations in an existing facility with inadequate wiring, it can be easier and less expensive to use wireless for a desktop",NT
"See the Topology, Cabling, and Hardware sections of this tutorial for more information on the configuration of a LAN",NT
Wide Area Network,NT
"Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Florida, the United States, or the world",NT
 Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite uplinks may be used to connect this type of global network,NT
"Using a WAN, schools in Florida can communicate with places like Tokyo in a matter of seconds, without paying enormous phone bills",NT
 Two users a half-world apart with workstations equipped with microphones and a webcams might teleconference in real time,NT
 A WAN is complicated,NT
" It uses multiplexers, bridges, and routers to connect local and metropolitan networks to global communications networks like the Internet",NT
" To users, however, a WAN will not appear to be much different than a LAN",NT
Advantages of Installing a School Network,NT
User access control,NT
Modern networks almost always have one or more servers which allows centralized management for users and for network resources to which they have access,NT
" User credentials on a privately-owned and operated network may be as simple as a user name and password, but with ever-increasing attention to computing security issues, these servers are critical to ensuring that sensitive information is only available to authorized users",NT
Information storing and sharing,NT
Computers allow users to create and manipulate information,NT
 Information takes on a life of its own on a network,NT
 The network provides both a place to store the information and mechanisms to share that information with other network users,NT
Connections,NT
"Administrators, instructors, and even students and guests can be connected using the campus network",NT
Services,NT
"The school can provide services, such as registration, school directories, course schedules, access to research, and email accounts, and many others",NT
" (Remember, network services are generally provided by servers)",NT
Internet,NT
"The school can provide network users with access to the internet, via an internet gateway",NT
Computing resources,NT
The school can provide access to special purpose computing devices which individual users would not normally own,NT
" For example, a school network might have high-speed high quality printers strategically located around a campus for instructor or student use",NT
Flexible Access,NT
School networks allow students to access their information from connected devices throughout the school,NT
" Students can begin an assignment in their classroom, save part of it on a public access area of the network, then go to the media center after school to finish their work",NT
 Students can also work cooperatively through the network,NT
Workgroup Computing,NT
Collaborative software allows many users to work on a document or project concurrently,NT
" For example, educators located at various schools within a county could simultaneously contribute their ideas about new curriculum standards to the same document, spreadsheets, or website",NT
Disadvantages of Installing a School Network,NT
Expensive to Install,NT
Large campus networks can carry hefty price tags,NT
" Cabling, network cards, routers, bridges, firewalls, wireless access points, and software can get expensive, and the installation would certainly require the services of technicians",NT
" But, with the ease of setup of home networks, a simple network with internet access can be setup for a small campus in an afternoon",NT
Requires Administrative Time,NT
Proper maintenance of a network requires considerable time and expertise,NT
" Many schools have installed a network, only to find that they did not budget for the necessary administrative support",NT
Servers Fail,NT
"Although a network server is no more susceptible to failure than any other computer, when the files server ""goes down"" the entire network may come to a halt",NT
 Good network design practices say that critical network services (provided by servers) should be redundant on the network whenever possible,NT
Cables May Break,NT
The Topology chapter presents information about the various configurations of cables,NT
" Some of the configurations are designed to minimize the inconvenience of a broken cable; with other configurations, one broken cable can stop the entire network",NT
Security and compliance,NT
Network security is expensive,NT
 It is also very important,NT
" A school network would possibly be subject to more stringent security requirements than a similarly-sized corporate network, because of its likelihood of storing personal and confidential information of network users, the danger of which can be compounded if any network users are minors",NT
 A great deal ,NT
" A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to allow data sharing",NT
" An example of a network is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over the world",NT
 To the right is an example image of a home network with multiple computers and other network devices all connected,NT
" The scientific community is in the midst of a boom of transcriptomics yet there are few accepted and standardized bioinformatics tools to organize, analyze, visualize and interpret the resulting big data",NT
" To deal with the challenges from such datasets, new-generation bioinformatics tools must be high performance (i",NT
" scalable for large data or user traffic), intuitive to use (i",NT
 to enable complex analytics via simple interface) and universally accessible (i,NT
" Here, we introduce NetworkAnalyst 3",NT
"0 as a powerful web-based visual analytics platform for comprehensive profiling, meta-analysis and systems-level interpretation of gene expression data",NT
 NetworkAnalyst was first released in 2014 centered on PPI network analysis and visualization (1),NT
 It was soon updated (version 2,NT
"0) in mid 2015, with a completely revamped user interface and enhanced workflow for statistical meta-analysis of multiple gene expression studies (2)",NT
" Over the years, we have made continuous updates and feature enhancements based on community feedback",NT
" According to Google Analytics, the public server has performed >220 000 data analysis jobs submitted from >14 000 users worldwide over the past 12-month period",NT
"The development of NetworkAnalyst, and subsequent updates, have been driven by the practical data analysis challenges facing researchers from a wide variety of different areas",NT
 Addressing these needs has required different levels of effort and expertise,NT
" At the basic level, we have expanded support from the initial five model organisms to currently 17 species covering mammals, birds, bacteria, plants and parasites",NT
" In addition, many researchers do not have access to high-end computational infrastructure, and thus we have developed and made available a public Galaxy server to support raw RNAseq processing for all the 17 species",NT
" At the intermediate level, we have spent significant efforts in curating high-quality, comprehensive molecular interaction data to allow users to create gene regulatory networks, tissue or cell-type specific networks as well as gene co-expression networks to enable more biologically meaningful analysis",NT
" For gene expression analysis, we have implemented an interactive volcano plot and added the widely-used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method (3)",NT
" At the advanced level, we have spent most of our efforts on developing and improving visual analytics methods to address several key challenges in biological big data analysis",NT
" To address the â€کhairballâ€™ effect associated with large network visualization, we have implemented 3D and VR network visualization",NT
" For networks with hierarchical structures such as enrichment network, we have developed a â€کmeta-nodeâ€™ feature which can be expanded to show more details upon user click",NT
" To overcome the limitations of Venn diagrams and chord diagrams, we have developed simple yet powerful heatmaps to allow users to intuitively compare gene lists of varying sizes for meta-analysis",NT
" Finally, NetworkAnalyst now allows users to save their data analysis projects and resume analysis later",NT
" Meanwhile, we have performed thorough code refactoring, updated the framework, and enhanced the user interface to significantly improve its efficiency and user experience",NT
 We have also updated the frequently asked questions (FAQs) and have added new tutorials for first time users,NT
 All these changes and updates have been released as NetworkAnalyst 3,NT
 It is now available freely at https://www,NT
networkanalyst,NT
"NetworkAnalyst accepts five types of data inputs - one or multiple gene lists, a single gene expression data table, multiple gene expression data tables, raw RNAseq reads as well as common network files",NT
" To start analysis, users can click the corresponding circular menu from the NetworkAnalyst home page",NT
 Each data input corresponds to a data analysis module with specific data processing steps,NT
 The analysis results will be presented in several highly interactive visual analytics methods with built-in support for functional enrichment analysis against multiple libraries available from our knowledgebase,NT
 The main workflow of NetworkAnalyst is summarized in Figure 1,NT
" In the following sections, we will focus primarily on the new or improved features introduced in the NetworkAnalyst 3",NT
 Other features can be found in our prior publications ,NT
" Enhancing gene expression analysisGiven the prevalence of transcriptome studies across life sciences, we have spent substantial effort in improving both the capacity and the workflow for gene expression analysis, with a particular focus on RNAseq data analysis and interpretation",NT
Raw RNAseq processing,NT
"NetworkAnalyst now features a Galaxy-based pipeline for processing raw RNAseq, which includes trimming, quality checking, read mapping and quantification",NT
" Inparticular, we have implemented both the classical spliced alignerâ€”HISAT2 ",NT
as well as the ultra-fast pseudoalignment based methodâ€”kallisto to support raw RNAseq mapping for the 17 species,NT
 The resulting gene count tables can then be used for gene expression analysis as described below,NT
 ll network communications involve the use of hardware and software,NT
 The network communication support is determined by the hardware and the software necessary to run that hardware and interface with the network,NT
,NT
Hardware consists of the physical equipment that is connected to the physical network,NT
 Software consists of the programs and device drivers that are associated with the operation of a particular system,NT
 The system hardware consists of adapter or other devices that provide a path or interface between the system software and the physical network,NT
 An adapter requires an I/O card slot in the system,NT
" An adapter prepares all inbound and outbound data; performs address searches; provides drivers, receivers, and surge protection; supports different interfaces; and in general relieves the system processor of many communications tasks",NT
Protocols,NT
"Protocols are sets of semantics and syntactical rules that define how information is delivered, how it is enclosed to reach its destination safely, and what path it follows",NT
 Protocols also coordinate the flow of messages and their acknowledgments,NT
Addresses,NT
A network domain is an administrative grouping of multiple computer networks or hosts within the same infrastructure,NT
 Domains put the data processing resources in a network under a common control,NT
"For example, the structure of the internet illustrates how domains define the Internet Protocol (IP) address",NT
 The internet is an extensive network that is made up of many different smaller networks,NT
" To facilitate routing and addressing, internet addresses are hierarchically structured in domains, with broad categories at the top such as com for commercial users, edu for educational users, and gov for government users",NT
" Within the com domain are many smaller domains corresponding to individual businesses; for example, ibm",NT
 Within the ibm,NT
"com domain are even smaller domains corresponding to the internet addresses for various locations, such as austin",NT
" At this level, you can identify names of hosts",NT
" A host, in this context, is any computer that is connected to the network",NT
 Within austin,NT
"com, there might be hosts with the names hamlet and lear, which are addressed hamlet",NT
Gateways and bridges,NT
A wide variety of networks reside on the internet that often uses different hardware and runs different software,NT
 Gateways and bridges enable these different networks to communicate with each other,NT
" A bridge is a functional unit that connects two LANs that possibly use the same logical link control (LLC) procedure, such as Ethernet, but different medium access control (MAC) procedures",NT
 A gateway has a broader range than a bridge,NT
" It operates above the link layer and, when required, converts the interface and protocol used by one network into those used by another distinct network",NT
 Gateways allow data transfers across the various networks that constitute the internet,NT
Data routing,NT
Using domain names for addressing and gateways for translation greatly facilitates the routing of the data that is being transferred,NT
 Routing is the assignment of a path by which a message reaches its destination,NT
 The domain name effectively defines the message destination,NT
" In a large network like the internet, information is routed from one communications network to the next until that information reaches its destination",NT
" Each communications network checks the domain name and based on the domains with which that network is familiar, routes the information on to the next logical stop",NT
" In this way, each communications network that receives the data contributes to the routing process",NT
Local and remote nodes,NT
A physical network is used by the hosts that reside on that network,NT
 Each host is a node on the network,NT
 A node is an addressable location in a communications network that provides host-processing services,NT
 The intercommunication of these various nodes is defined as local or remote,NT
" Local pertains to a device, file, or system accessed directly from your system, without the use of a communications line",NT
" Remote pertains to a device, file, or system accessed by your system over a communications line",NT
" Local files reside on your system, while remote files reside on a file server or at another node with which you communicate by using a physical network, for example, Ethernet, token-ring, or phone lines",NT
Client and Server,NT
A server is a computer that contains data or provides facilities to be accessed by other computers on the network,NT
 A client is a computer that requests services or data from a server,NT
" Common server types are file servers, which store files; name servers, which store names and addresses; and application servers, which store programs and applications; print servers, which schedule and direct print jobs to their destination",NT
A client can request updated program code or the use of applications from a code server,NT
" To obtain a name or address, a client contacts a name server",NT
" A client can also request files and data for data entry, inquiry, or record update from a file server",NT
 Computer Network Or network Is a group of computers and devices,NT
 Being connected to the network can communicate,NT
" information exchange And equipment Network sharing ""network that has multiple dimensions",NT

 Convolution layers take inner product of the linear filter and the underlying receptive field followed by a nonlinear activation function at every local portion of the input,NT
 The resulting outputs are called feature maps,NT
" The convolution filter in CNN is a generalized linear model (GLM) for the underlying data patch, and we argue that the level of abstraction is low with GLM",NT
 By abstraction we mean that the feature is invariant to the variants of the same concept [2],NT
 Replacing the GLM with a more potent nonlinear function approximator can enhance the abstraction ability of the local model,NT
" GLM can achieve a good extent of abstraction when the samples of the latent concepts are linearly separable, i",NT
 the variants of the concepts all live on one side of the separation plane defined by the GLM,NT
 Thus conventional CNN implicitly makes the assumption that the latent concepts are linearly separable,NT
" However, the data for the same concept often live on a nonlinear manifold, therefore the representations that capture these concepts are generally highly nonlinear function of the input",NT
" In NIN, the GLM is replaced with a â€‌micro networkâ€‌ structure which is a general nonlinear function approximator",NT
" In this work, we choose multilayer perceptron [3] as the instantiation of the micro network, which is a universal function approximator and a neural network trainable by back-propagation",NT
 The resulting structure which we call an mlpconv layer is compared with CNN in Figure 1,NT
 Both the linear convolutional layer and the mlpconv layer map the local receptive field to an output feature vector,NT
 The mlpconv maps the input local patch to the output feature vector with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) consisting of multiple fully connected layers with nonlinear activation functions,NT
 The MLP is shared among all local receptive fields,NT
 The feature maps are obtained by sliding the MLP,NT
 Classic convolutional neuron networks [1] consist of alternatively stacked convolutional layers and spatial pooling layers,NT
" The convolutional layers generate feature maps by linear convolutional filters followed by nonlinear activation functions (rectifier, sigmoid, tanh, etc",NT
 NetworkAnalyst contains many features and functions for a variety of purposes and applications,NT
" In particular, NetworkAnalyst supports flexible differential expression analysis (DEA, see Box 1 for glossary) for a wide array of experimental designs including two or multiple group comparisons, time series, commonreference design, nested comparisons, as well as paired or block design",NT
" The underlying statistics are based on the well-established limma package29, which was initially designed for microarray data analysis and has recently been extended to also support RNA-seq data30",NT
" For microarray data from humans and mice, NetworkAnalyst contains built-in support for popular commercial microarray platforms from Affymetrix GeneChip, Illuminaâ€™s BeadArray and Agilent one-color microarrays",NT
" For data from RNA-seq or other array platforms, users need to first convert the platform-specific feature IDs to common gene or transcript IDs (Entrez, RefSeq, Genbank or Ensembl) before uploading the expression tables to NetworkAnalyst",NT
 Details on DEA will not be covered in this protocol,NT
" Instead, this protocol focuses on three unique features of NetworkAnalyst, network analysis, visual analytics and meta-analysis, through analysis of three separate example data sets",NT
" For more technical details or introductions to other features, users are encouraged to consult our screenshot tutorials and FAQs posted on the NetworkAnalyst website (http://www",NT
 networkanalyst,NT
" Limitations of the software and protocol NetworkAnalyst currently supports only five model organisms (human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), for which high-quality PPI data are available",NT
" The underlying protein interaction data were obtained from InnateDB11 (for human and mouse), a member of the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium31, and iRefIndex32 (for other three species)",NT
" Both databases provide comprehensive PPI coverage by integrating data from a number of primary interaction databases including BIND33, BioGrid34, MINT35, IntAct36 and so on",NT
 NetworkAnalyst has been designed as a high-performance web application for real-time interactive data analysis and visual exploration,NT
" When a user begins analysis, a temporary folder is created in which to save user data",NT
 The folder is removed after the session completes,NT
" However, visual data mining is an iterative process, and many users have requested to be allowed to continue previous analyses instead of starting from the beginning each time",NT
" Thus, although the public server does not allow users to permanently store their data to enable them to resume analysis at a later date, we recently added the capability to allow users to download a copy of the session file",NT
" When they return, they can simply upload the session file to enter the visual analytics page without having to repeat the time-consuming data preparation steps",NT
 Server performance is another potential limitation when many users upload large data sets at approximately the same time,NT
" The public server currently limits each user to upload a maximum of 1,000 samples",NT
 Researchers who wish to conduct very large-scale meta-analyses are encouraged to contact the authors to obtain a copy of NetworkAnalyst to install on their local server (Mac or Linux based),NT
" Biological networks are usually large and complex, without inherent coordinates to enable easy navigation (see Fig",NT
 3 for an example),NT
" Efficient layout, searching and zooming and customization are crucial support functions during network analysis",NT
 Network layout: good layout algorithms arrange nodes in a way that balances both visual perception and aesthetics,NT
 NetworkAnalyst offers several state-of-the-art network layout algorithms based on the well-known Gephi software48,NT
 Searching and zooming: this function allows users to pinpoint their genes of interest within a complex network,NT
 NetworkAnalyst will automatically perform a search and zoom in when the user clicks on or enters a node name for search,NT
 Customization: it is very rare that the default layout or style will be satisfactory; further manual adjustments are often needed to improve the quality and to enhance biological insights,NT
" In NetworkAnalyst, the size, color and position of nodes can be customized individually or in batch mode (i",NT

" When a user begins analysis, a temporary folder is created in which to save user data",NT
 The folder is removed after the session completes,NT
" However, visual data mining is an iterative process, and many users have requested to be allowed to continue previous analyses instead of starting from the beginning each time",NT

 Convolution layers take inner product of the linear filter and the underlying receptive field followed by a nonlinear activation function at every local portion of the input,NT
 The resulting outputs are called feature maps,NT
" The convolution filter in CNN is a generalized linear model (GLM) for the underlying data patch, and we argue that the level of abstraction is low with GLM",NT
 By abstraction we mean that the feature is invariant to the variants of the same concept [2],NT
 Replacing the GLM with a more potent nonlinear function approximator can enhance the abstraction ability of the local model,NT
" GLM can achieve a good extent of abstraction when the samples of the latent concepts are linearly separable, i",NT
 the variants of the concepts all live on one side of the separation plane defined by the GLM,NT
 Thus conventional CNN implicitly makes the assumption that the latent concepts are linearly separable,NT
" However, the data for the same concept often live on a nonlinear manifold, therefore the representations that capture these concepts are generally highly nonlinear function of the input",NT
" In NIN, the GLM is replaced with a â€‌micro networkâ€‌ structure which is a general nonlinear function approximator",NT
" In this work, we choose multilayer perceptron [3] as the instantiation of the micro network, which is a universal function approximator and a neural network trainable by back-propagation",NT
 The resulting structure which we call an mlpconv layer is compared with CNN in Figure 1,NT
 Both the linear convolutional layer and the mlpconv layer map the local receptive field to an output feature vector,NT
 The mlpconv maps the input local patch to the output feature vector with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) consisting of multiple fully connected layers with nonlinear activation functions,NT
 The MLP is shared among all local receptive fields,NT
 The feature maps are obtained by sliding the MLP,NT
 Classic convolutional neuron networks [1] consist of alternatively stacked convolutional layers and spatial pooling layers,NT
" The convolutional layers generate feature maps by linear convolutional filters followed by nonlinear activation functions (rectifier, sigmoid, tanh, etc",NT
 NetworkAnalyst contains many features and functions for a variety of purposes and applications,NT
" In particular, NetworkAnalyst supports flexible differential expression analysis (DEA, see Box 1 for glossary) for a wide array of experimental designs including two or multiple group comparisons, time series, commonreference design, nested comparisons, as well as paired or block design",NT
" The underlying statistics are based on the well-established limma package29, which was initially designed for microarray data analysis and has recently been extended to also support RNA-seq data30",NT
" For microarray data from humans and mice, NetworkAnalyst contains built-in support for popular commercial microarray platforms from Affymetrix GeneChip, Illuminaâ€™s BeadArray and Agilent one-color microarrays",NT
" For data from RNA-seq or other array platforms, users need to first convert the platform-specific feature IDs to common gene or transcript IDs (Entrez, RefSeq, Genbank or Ensembl) before uploading the expression tables to NetworkAnalyst",NT

"Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) is research in the design and the use of computer technology, which focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and computers",CHI
 HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways,CHI
"As a field of research, humanâ€“computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study",CHI
 The term was popularized by Stuart K,CHI
" Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P",CHI
" Moran in their 1983 book, The Psychology of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction",CHI
 The first known use was in 1975 by Carlisle,CHI
"[1] The term is intended to convey that, unlike other tools with specific and limited uses, computers have many uses which often involve an open-ended dialogue between the user and the computer",CHI
 The notion of dialogue likens humanâ€“computer interaction to human-to-human interaction: an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field,CHI
" Humans interact with computers in many ways, and the interface between the two is crucial to facilitating this interaction",CHI
" HCI is also sometimes termed humanâ€“machine interaction (HMI), man-machine interaction (MMI) or computer-human interaction (CHI)",CHI
" Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI) of today",CHI
"[4] Voice user interfaces (VUI) are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms",CHI
" The growth in humanâ€“computer interaction field has led to an increase in the quality of interaction, and resulted in many new areas of research beyond",CHI
" Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches focus on the concepts of multimodality[5] over unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces over command/action based ones, and active interfaces over passive interfaces",CHI
"The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines humanâ€“computer interaction as ""a discipline that is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them""",CHI
[4] An important facet of HCI is user satisfaction (or End-User Computing Satisfaction),CHI
" It goes on to say:""Because humanâ€“computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side",CHI
" On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are relevant",CHI
" On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant",CHI
" And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant",CHI
"[4]Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success.Poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example is the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.[6][7][8] Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instruments or throttle quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the standard"" layout",CHI
" Thus, the conceptually good idea had unintended results",CHI
The humanâ€“computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer,CHI
 The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction,CHI
" The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including:Visual Based: The visual-based humanâ€“computer interaction is probably the most widespread humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) research area",CHI
Audio Based: The audio-based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of HCI systems,CHI
 This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals,CHI
Task environment: The conditions and goals set upon the user,CHI
"Machine environment: The computer's environment is connected to, e",CHI
", a laptop in a college student's dorm room",CHI
"Areas of the interface: Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer, not about their interaction",CHI
" Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes of their interaction",CHI
Input flow: The flow of information begins in the task environment when the user has some task requiring using their computer,CHI
Output: The flow of information that originates in the machine environment,CHI
"Feedback: Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back",CHI
"Fit: This matches the computer design, the user, and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task",CHI
"Humanâ€“computer interaction studies the ways in which humans makeâ€”or do not makeâ€”use of computational artifacts, systems, and infrastructures",CHI
 Much of the research in this field seeks to improve the humanâ€“computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces,CHI
"[9] How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and cultural values, and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated",CHI
" Methods for designing new computer interfaces, thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability, findability, the efficiency of use",CHI
"Methods for implementing interfaces, e",CHI
", by means of software libraries",CHI
Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties,CHI
Methods for studying humanâ€“computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly,CHI
Methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer,CHI
"Models and theories of humanâ€“computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces, sucas cognitivist user models, Activity Theory, or ethnomethodological accounts of humanâ€“computer use",CHI
" Perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design, computer use, and HCI research practice",CHI
 Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve might vary,CHI
" When pursuing a cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities",CHI
" When pursuing a post-cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values",CHI
"Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies, experimenting with devices, prototyping software and hardware systems, exploring interaction paradigms, and developing models and theories of interaction",CHI
"Early focus is placed on the user(s) and task(s): How many users are needed to perform the task(s) is established and who the appropriate users should be is determined (someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user)",CHI
" In addition, the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed is defined",CHI
Empirical measurement: the interface is tested with real users who come in contact with the interface daily,CHI
 The results can vary with the performance level of the user and the typical humanâ€“computer interaction may not always be represented,CHI
" Quantitative usability specifics, such as the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s) are determined",CHI
"Iterative design: After determining what users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, the following iterative design steps",CHI
"The iterative design process is repeated until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created",CHI
Various strategies delineating methods for humanâ€“PC interaction design have developed since the conception of the field during the 1980s,CHI
" Most plan philosophies come from a model for how clients, originators, and specialized frameworks interface",CHI
" Early techniques treated clients' psychological procedures as unsurprising and quantifiable and urged plan specialists to look at subjective science to establish zones, (for example, memory and consideration) when structuring UIs",CHI
" Present-day models, in general, center around a steady input and discussion between clients, creators, and specialists and push for specialized frameworks to be folded with the sorts of encounters clients need to have, as opposed to wrapping user experience around a finished framework",CHI
Activity theory: utilized in HCI to characterize and consider the setting where human cooperations with PCs occur,CHI
 Action hypothesis gives a structure for reasoning about activities in these specific circumstances and illuminates the design of interactions from an action-driven perspective,CHI
"User-centered design (UCD): a cutting-edge, broadly-rehearsed plan theory established on the possibility that clients must become the overwhelming focus in the plan of any PC framework",CHI
" Clients, architects, and specialized experts cooperate to determine the requirements and restrictions of the client and make a framework to support these components",CHI
" Frequently, client-focused plans are informed by ethnographic investigations of situations in which clients will associate with the framework",CHI
" This training is like participatory design, which underscores the likelihood for end-clients to contribute effectively through shared plan sessions and workshops",CHI
"Principles of UI design: these standards may be considered during the design of a client interface: resistance, effortlessness, permeability, affordance, consistency, structure, and feedback",CHI
"Value sensitive design (VSD): a technique for building innovation that accounts for the individuals who utilize the design straightforwardly, and just as well for those who the design influences, either directly or indirectly",CHI
" VSD utilizes an iterative plan process that includes three kinds of examinations: theoretical, exact, and specialized",CHI
" Applied examinations target the understanding and articulation of the different parts of the design, and its qualities or any clashes that may emerge for the users of the design",CHI
" Exact examinations are subjective or quantitative plans to explore things used to advise the creators' understanding regarding the clients' qualities, needs, and practices",CHI
 Specialized examinations can include either investigation of how individuals use related advances or the framework plans,CHI
Displays are human-made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and facilitate further processing of that information,CHI
" Before a display is designed, the task that the display is intended to support must be defined (e",CHI
" A user or operator must be able to process whatever information a system generates and displays; therefore, the information must be displayed according to principles to support perception, situation awareness, and understanding",CHI
Christopher Wickens et al,CHI
 defined 13 principles of display design in their book An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering,CHI
[18]These principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design,CHI
" A reduction in errors, a reduction in required training time, an increase in efficiency, and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved by utilizing these principles",CHI
Certain principles may not apply to different displays or situations,CHI
" Some principles may also appear to be conflicting, and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another",CHI
 The principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation,CHI
 Striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design,CHI
 Make displays legible (or audible),CHI
 A display's legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display,CHI
" If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, the operator cannot effectively use them",CHI
 Avoid absolute judgment limits,CHI
 Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable based on a single sensory variable (e,CHI
" color, size, loudness)",CHI
 These sensory variables can contain many possible levels,CHI
 Top-down processing,CHI
 Signals are likely perceived and interpreted by what is expected based on a user's experience,CHI
" If a signal is presented contrary to the user's expectation, more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly",CHI
Redundancy gain,CHI
" If a signal is presented more than once, it is more likely to be understood correctly",CHI
 This can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms (e,CHI
 as redundancy does not imply repetition,CHI
" A traffic light is a good example of redundancy, as color and position are redundant",CHI
 Similarity causes confusion: Use distinguishable elements,CHI
 Signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused,CHI
 The ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar,CHI
" For example, A423B9 is more similar to A423B8 than 92 is to 93",CHI
" Unnecessarily similar features should be removed, and dissimilar features should be highlighted",CHI
Principle of pictorial realism,CHI
 A display should look like the variable that it represents (e,CHI
the high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level),CHI
" If there are multiple elements, they can be configured in a manner that looks like they would in the represented environment",CHI
 Principle of the moving part,CHI
 Moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user's mental model of how it actually moves in the system,CHI
" For example, the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude",CHI
Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world,CHI
 A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long-term memory,CHI
" A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory",CHI
" However, memory use may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some knowledge globally (e",CHI
an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual),CHI
 The use of knowledge in a user's head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design,CHI
Principle of predictive aiding,CHI
 Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions,CHI
 A display should eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the user's mental resources,CHI
 This will allow the user to focus on current conditions and to consider possible future conditions,CHI
 An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination,CHI
Principle of consistency,CHI
 Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support the processing of new displays if they are designed consistently,CHI
 A user's long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate,CHI
 A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays,CHI
Social computing,CHI
Social computing is an interactive and collaborative behavior considered between technology and people,CHI
" In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis, as there are a lot of social computing technologies that include blogs, emails, social networking, quick messaging, and various others",CHI
" Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology",CHI
" For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name",CHI
" Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more negatively than humans, despite behaving the same way towards these machines",CHI
[21]Knowledge-driven humanâ€“computer interaction,CHI
"In human and computer interactions, a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors",CHI
" Ontology, as a formal representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem by solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties",CHI
Emotions and humanâ€“computer interaction,CHI
"HCI arose as a field from intertwined roots in computer graphics, operating systems, HF, ergonomics, industrial engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science",CHI
 The cognitive aspects of users will be discussed later in this article,CHI
"The early history of computer graphics, involving cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays and pen devices, led to the development of much of today's HCI techniques in the area of GUIs",CHI
 Sutherland's 1963 MIT doctoral thesis on Sketchpad essentially marked the beginning of computer graphics as a discipline,CHI
" This early work described direct-manipulation interaction techniques, where users performed actions on screen entities to represent commands",CHI
" The program allowed users to draw lines, circles, and points on a computer's CRT display using a light pen",CHI
" While these tasks are simple to program and use with today's computer hardware, software, and interfaces, nearly 40 years ago this was a revolutionary effort that required immense computing power",CHI
 Sutherland's program assigned characteristics to graphic objects and built relationships between objects,CHI
" Users could move, copy, scale, zoom, rotate objects, and save object characteristics",CHI
" Although this research never was commercially developed, most software engineers credit Sutherland's Sketchpad research and designs as the first step in the evolution of GUIs",CHI
"Early research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) produced a number of important building blocks for HCI, including the mouse, bitmapped displays, personal computers (PCs), windows, the desktop metaphor, and point-and-click editors",CHI
" The mouse, now a critical input device for most computer users, was developed in the late 1960s",CHI
" Douglas Engelbart began his work in 1964 on a handheld pointing device at SRI International in Menlo Park, CA, and carried on with his experimental designs at Xerox PARC",CHI
 The culmination of this work was the first patent for the wheel mouse in 1970,CHI
 Continued research and design on the mouse led to the patent for the ball mouse in 1974 by Xerox,CHI
" The idea came suddenly to Ron Rider, â€œI suggested that they turn a trackball upside down, make it small, and use it as a mouse instead",CHI
 Easiest patent I ever got,CHI
" It took me five minutes to think of, half an hour to describe to the attorney, and I was done",CHI
"â€‌ Apple Computer redesigned the mouse in 1979, using a rubber ball rather than a metal one",CHI
 Variations on the ball mouse are what GUI users mostly mouse with today,CHI
The first operating system designed around the GUI was a Xerox in-house computer system called the Alto in the early 1970s,CHI
" It had multiple, overlapping windows; used pop-up menus; and, of course, came with a mouse",CHI
" Around 1976, icons were added to the on-screen desktop",CHI
" The research and design of the Alto system led to the first commercial GUI product, the Xerox Star, in 1981",CHI
" The Xerox Star offered both tiled and overlapping windows, a menu bar for each window, and, of course, the mouse",CHI
 The Xerox Star was the first computer to follow the idea of the â€œdesktop metaphor,CHI
â€‌ The desktop metaphor is still the guiding metaphor for GUI today,CHI
Smith et al,CHI
" (1982) described the Xerox Star as, â€œEvery user's initial view of Star is the Desktop, which resembles the top of an office desk, together with surrounding furniture and equipment",CHI
" It represents a working environment, where current projects and accessible resources reside",CHI
" On the screen are displayed pictures of familiar office objects, such as documents, folders, file drawers, in-baskets, and out-baskets",CHI
" These objects are displayed as small pictures, or icons",CHI
â€‌ This is the beginning of the desktop metaphor that users now see on computer screens across the world,CHI
 Metaphors are further discussed later in this article,CHI
"The Xerox PARC engineers were successful at research and technology, but ultimately unsuccessful at developing commercial products",CHI
" The Xerox Star was never a success, even though over 30 man-years of work went into the product",CHI
 The development of the first successful GUI computer systems was left to Apple Computer,CHI
" The transition of research and technology to product development from Xerox to Apple was both a friendly and profitable one, as Xerox held 800,000 shares of Apple stock when it went public in December 1980",CHI
"Steven Jobs, a founder of Apple, visited Xerox PARC and viewed their research on graphical interfaces",CHI
 He returned to Apple very excited about GUIs and infused his design teams with that enthusiasm,CHI
 The rest is history,CHI
" The Apple Lisa, the precursor to the Macintosh, came out in 1983",CHI
" Like the Xerox Star, it was not a commercial success",CHI
" It took the introduction of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984, with a revolutionary advertising approach, to successfully bring GUIs to the computer market successfully",CHI
 Both the Lisa and the Macintosh had a menu bar for the entire screen and the first pull-down menus in a graphical interface,CHI
 An Apple designer received a patent for pull-down menus in 1984,CHI
Apple's success with the GUI is legendary and still remains the most familiar example of GUIs,CHI
" As I try to explain what GUIs are to unknowing computer users, I often say, â€œYou know, it's like the Apple Mac",CHI
"â€‌ After Apple's immense success with the Macintosh GUI, an operating system revolution was upon us, and both IBM and Microsoft went to work on PC-based GUIs of their own, along with a number of other software developers",CHI
 These companies had a lot of catching up to do and had to do it on a hardware platform very different from the Apple Macintosh,CHI
 One key advantage that Apple had is that they built the whole computer themselves as an integrated system,CHI
 Their design philosophy followed the Xerox PARC design methodology,CHI
 Jones described how the Xerox Star was built,CHI
 â€œStar began by defining a conceptual model of how users would relate to the system,CHI
" The interface was completed before the computer hardware had been built on which to run it, and two years before a single line of product software code had been written",CHI
â€‌ Many other software and hardware products failed in the marketplace because they did not follow this design approach,CHI
" Products and their interfaces should be designed for users, and the users should be involved in the product design process ",CHI
Responsiveness Principle 4: All delays are not equal: software need not do everything immediately,CHI
Some events require immediate feedback; some donâ€™t,CHI
 Software can therefore prioritize its handling of user events in order to give timely feedback where it is needed and delay other tasks,CHI
"As described above, for handâ€“eye coordination tasks, keystroke-level feedback must be immediate to be effective",CHI
" Internal bookkeeping, updating areas of the screen where users arenâ€™t working, results of explicitly requested calculations or searches need not be immediate",CHI
"The classic UI design handbook Humanâ€“Computer Interface Design Guidelines [Brown, 1988] uses the concept of task â€œclosureâ€‌ to determine when software response delays are acceptable or unacceptable",CHI
A key factor determining acceptable response delays is level of closureâ€¦,CHI
 A delay after completing a major unit of work may not bother a user or adversely affect performance,CHI
" Delays between minor steps in a larger unit of work, however, may cause the user to forget the next planned steps",CHI
" In general, actions with high levels of closure, such as saving a completed document to a file, are less sensitive to response time delays",CHI
" Actions at the lowest levels of closure, such as typing a character and seeing it echoed on the display, are most sensitive to response time delays",CHI
Trying to make all system responses equally fast cannot succeed,CHI
" Everything canâ€™t happen at once and even if it could, users couldnâ€™t perceive it all",CHI
Instant responses to certain user actions can even be undesirable,CHI
 Faster is not always better,CHI
 Users donâ€™t trust complex searches or computations that finish too quickly,CHI
" A slight delay, blink, animation, or other feedback may be needed when a display changes to make users notice the change or believe that work was done",CHI
 Many old computer games canâ€™t be played on todayâ€™s computers because they were optimized for maximum speed on slow computers and run too fast on newer ones,CHI
" Thus, the deadlines given for different types of feedback are not simply maximums, they are goals",CHI
"A manual examination of embedded systems utilizes human computer interfaces like key input and display output, to extract as much data as possible",CHI
 Reasons for choosing such a low-tech examination method include,CHI
"In some cases, speed is more important than forensic soundness",CHI
" If it is only important to know the value of the last trip counter of a car, it makes sense to switch on that car instead of spending a lot of time developing a forensically sound extraction procedure",CHI
With other methods it is not possible to extract certain evidence or to guarantee the integrity of certain data elements,CHI
" Some mobile phones for example, have data cable connection points inside the battery compartment",CHI
 Removing the battery to access these points may alter the date and time values of the phone,CHI
 If these values are expected to be important they can be extracted via the user menu of the phone,CHI
The conversion of extracted data into information (decoding) is problematic,CHI
" If no documentation is available on how specific data are formatted and all attempts to decode the data fail, the device itself might be a useful tool",CHI
" In a mobile phone examination for example, data related to deleted voice dialing commands were found but it was not possible to play these voice tags with any available sound player",CHI
" Through testing it was discovered how the phone coded the delete status of a voice tag and after flipping the deleted status data back to nondeleted, the voice tags could be played via the original phone",CHI
The investigator needs to have the technical documentation for the system and needs to be experienced in manual examination of the target device,CHI
 This will avoid data being unwittingly lost or affected,CHI
8 All the operations need to be documented and it must be stated in the final report that the data have been extracted manually,CHI
 Manual acquisition does not guarantee that all data are retrieved and also has the disadvantage of possible human (typographic) errors,CHI
" For computer assisted manual examinations, forensic tools exist that use a camera and computer software for documenting screen contents during a manual examination (Fernico, 2007; Project-a-Phone, 2007)",CHI
"During an investigation related to the death of a baby, a digital fever thermometer was examined",CHI
 The police wanted to know the last measured temperature,CHI
 After contacting the manufacturer and conducting tests with a reference device it turned out that the last measured temperature could be displayed by holding down the power button for a few seconds after powering on the device,CHI
Interactive Applications and Environments,CHI
Understanding the interaction between a computer and a human remains one of the enduring challenges in designing humanâ€“computer interfaces,CHI
 Visual cues are the most important mode of nonverbal communication,CHI
 Effective utilization of gestures and activities holds the promise of helping in creating computers that can better interact with humans,CHI
" Similarly, interactive environments such as smart rooms [12] that can react to a user's activities can benefit from vision-based methods",CHI
" However, such technologies are still not mature enough to stand the â€œTuring testâ€‌ and thus continue to attract research interest",CHI
The computer/human interface refers to the modalities through which people interact with computational technologies,CHI
" Looked at over the last half century, the trend has been from a style of interaction in which the computer is approached as a mechanism to a style of interaction in which the computer is approached as a behaving and aware organism",CHI
" This first trend has been related to another, from people acting directly on the machine to acting indirectly on its increasingly elaborate self presentation in which many layers of programming stand between underlying processes and what is presented to the user",CHI
 This movement is more than technical,CHI
" Computational technologies have served as objects to think with, that is, as carrier objects for ideas",CHI
" Through their changing interfaces, the computer has moved from being the carrier object of a culture of calculation to that of a culture of simulation",CHI
 The culture of simulation promotes a way of understanding in which users are encouraged to take computers â€کat interface value,CHI
Extending Visualization to Perceptualization: The Importance of Perception in Effective Communication of Information,CHI
 The essence of any humanâ€“computer interface is to convey information,CHI
 Visualization has been a good information communication tool for more than two decades,CHI
" While many visualization systems provide users with a better understanding of their data, they are often difficult to use and are not a reliable, accurate tool for conveying information, which limits their acceptance and use",CHI
" As scientists, medical researchers, and information analysts face drastic growth in the size of their datasets, the efficient, accurate, and reproducible communication of information becomes essential",CHI
 These problems become even worse when the datasets under investigation are multivariate and/or vector datasets,CHI
"Therefore, we need a fundamental change in the development of visualization techniques",CHI
 Traditional visualization must evolve into perceptualization of information: conveying information through multiple perceptual channels and perceptually tuned rendering techniques,CHI
" The choice of visual rendering techniques should be driven by characteristics of human perception, since perceptual channels are the communication medium",CHI
 This chapter summarizes some basics of human perception and show several examples of how this perceptual basis can be used to drive new perceptualization techniques,CHI
"Throughout history, humans have tried to effectively convey important information through the use of images, using techniques such as illustrations, photographs, and detailed technical drawings",CHI
 These techniques harness the enormous bandwidth and preattentive processing of the human visual system,CHI
" Many disciplines of study have evolved to further these techniques, including photography, technical and medical illustration, and now visualization",CHI
" While illustration and photography are both successful at capturing and conveying information, they utilize different techniques and characteristics of the human visual system to convey information",CHI
" Photography concentrates on conveying information with light and color variation, while illustration additionally tries to effectively convey information by omitting unimportant details, enhancing the most significant components of the image, simplifying complex features, and exposing hidden features ",CHI
 Scientific illustrations have been used for centuries because of their effective communicative ability ,CHI
"The effectiveness of illustration techniques, the amazing power of the human perceptual system, and the enormous data deluge facing information analysts, medical researchers, and scientific researchers have motivated us to explore the possible extension of visualization techniques to perceptualization",CHI
" The goal of perceptualization is to concisely convey information to the user through the creation of effective perceptual human inputs (visual, proprioceptive, and haptic)",CHI
Humanâ€“machine interfaces for medical imaging and clinical interventions,CHI
"16 Objective evaluation of performance on a task mediated by an interfaceBefore the advent of humanâ€“computer interfaces, Experimental Psychologists had known that the objective evaluation of performance on a task can be formulated by considering both the time (or speed) and the error rate (or accuracy) of the sequence of actions which make up the overarching task [25,33,31]",CHI
 They had also known that these are the only objective measures that can be made,CHI
" And more recently, due to the prevalent theories and empirical support of the speedâ€“accuracy trade-off, it has become recognized that these two measures cannot be disentangled",CHI
" Put succinctly and emphatically, â€œperformance of a task is the product of speed and accuracy, relative to that taskâ€‌",CHI
" (Within the HMI literature, this fundamental principle goes back as far as Fitts or perhaps Woodworth ",CHI
" What we would like to emphasize here is that there are no other objective metrics of performance (any other would either be noncausal correlate measures, or worse, be â€œsubjectiveâ€‌, and consequently prone to all of the cognitive and methodological biases that make subjective evaluations a very weak hand to play)",CHI
There is an easy Gedankenexperiment that can be conducted in this regard,CHI
" Pretend, for the sake of argument, that there might be, say, three objective metrics of performance: â€œSpeed, Accuracy, and Path Lengthâ€‌",CHI
" Well, then, what happens if your data shows that you have improved your speed and decreased your path length, but your accuracy is lower? Presumably that calls your performance into question",CHI
" And what if you have improved your accuracy and decreased your path length, but you have been much slower? Well, then, have you improved your performance by being much slower while taking a shorter path? Really? But now: what if you have improved your speed and your accuracy, but not your path length? Well, from the perspective of the task â€“ the increase in path length is irrelevant",CHI
" As long as your speed and accuracy are both better, then, by definition, your performance has improved",CHI
â€œPath lengthâ€‌ would only arise as a metric if it was explicitly made part of the goals of the task,CHI
" In this case, it would be a dual task, such as when you are asked to â€œpoint to a target while at the same time minimizing your path length",CHI
"â€‌ Then, in that case, you have two tasks â€“ and you can consider the speed and accuracy of both of those tasks, and then consider whether or not there exists a trade-off between accuracy constraints of the two tasks â€“ in which you will need to consider some weighting function if you need to extract a single performance measure from this dual task",CHI
" Alternately, you can extract performance metrics on the two aspects of the dual task",CHI
"This principle of objective performance metrics based on speed and accuracy can be applied hierarchically to any particular subtask of an overarching task; whether they comprised goal-directed movements, or discrete choice-based tasks (where in the discrete case, one considers the reciprocals of the task time and the error rate)",CHI
" While we have tried to provide an encompassing review of a broad area of research, we do hope that this article has been an argument that champions this particular emphatic point about the quantitative evaluation of humanâ€“machine interfaces for Medical Imaging, and Computer-Assisted Interventions",CHI
"Given the complexity of the humanâ€“computer interface, it is clear that evaluation protocols that address a large number of different types of speech-based input systems are required",CHI
" The majority of research in the area of speech-based input system evaluation has concentrated on evaluating system components, such as measuring the word recognition accuracy for a speech recognizer, rather than on overall effectiveness measures for complete systems",CHI
"In order to give the reader information on how to evaluate the performance of speech-based input systems, this section first introduces various performance measures, followed by discussions of the parameters that affect the performance",CHI
" The section then goes on to an evaluation framework, which includes high-level sophisticated metrics such as correction and transaction success",CHI
"To obtain a more detailed description of various evaluation techniques for speech-based input systems, readers are encouraged to refer to the handbook by Gibbon et al",CHI
"With some justification, one can see the evolution of the human-computer interface as a slow but relentless progress toward a more NUI-like interface: one that enables skillful performance rapidly without diminishing the result, and perhaps enhancing it",CHI
HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings,CHI
"As its name implies, HCI consists of three parts: the user, the computer itself, and the ways they work together",CHI
"By ""user"", we may mean an individual user, a group of users working together",CHI
" An appreciation of the way people's sensory systems (sight, hearing, touch) relay information is vital",CHI
" Also, different users form different conceptions or mental models about their interactions and have different ways of learning and keeping knowledge and",CHI
" In addition, cultural and national differences play a part",CHI
"When we talk about the computer, we're referring to any technology ranging from desktop computers, to large scale computer systems",CHI
" For example, if we were discussing the design of a Website, then the Website itself would be referred to as ""the computer""",CHI
 Devices such as mobile phones or VCRs can also be considered to be â€œcomputersâ€‌,CHI
There are obvious differences between humans and machines,CHI
" In spite of these, HCI attempts to ensure that they both get on with each other and interact successfully",CHI
" In order to achieve a usable system, you need to apply what you know about humans and computers, and consult with likely users throughout the design process",CHI
" In real systems, the schedule and the budget are important, and it is vital to find a balance between what would be ideal for the users and what is feasible in reality",CHI
The Goals of HCI,CHI
"The goals of HCI are to produce usable and safe systems, as well as functional systems",CHI
" In order o produce computer systems with good usability, developers must attempt to:",CHI
understand the factors that determine how people use technology,CHI
develop tools and techniques to enable building suitable systems,CHI
"achieve efficient, effective, and safe interactioN",CHI
put people first,CHI
Underlying the whole theme of HCI is the belief that people using a computer system should come first,CHI
" Their needs, capabilities and preferences for conducting various tasks should direct developers in the way that they design systems",CHI
 People should not have to change the way that they use a system in order to fit in with it,CHI
" Instead, the system should be designed to match their requirements",CHI
Usability is one of the key concepts in HCI,CHI
 It is concerned with making systems easy to learn and use,CHI
 A usable system is,CHI
easy to learn,CHI
easy to remember how to useMany everyday systems and products seem to be designed with little regard to usability,CHI
" This leads to frustration, wasted time and errors",CHI
" Productivity FactorsIncrease output, increase quality, decrease costs, decrease errors, increase innovation",CHI
Disciplines contributing to HCI,CHI
"The field of HCI covers a wide range of topics, and its development has relied on contributionsfrom many disciplines",CHI
 Some of the main disciplines which have contributed to HCI are:,CHI
"Computer Science technologyo software design, development & maintenance o User Interface Management Systems (UIMS) & User Interface Development Environments (UIDE) o prototyping tools o graphics",CHI
Cognitive Psychology information processing  capabilities limitations  cooperative working performance prediction,CHI
"Human-Computer Interaction is an interdisciplinary field of study interested in design, evaluation and implementation of interactive technology",CHI
" Since Human-Computer Interaction studies the interaction between human and computer, it is associated with the study fields suach as human behavior, psychology, cognitive science, computer science and software engineering as well as ergonomics, graphic and industrial design, sociology, anthropology and educational sciences [1]",CHI
"Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has four main components: the user, task, tools / interface, the context",CHI
 HCI studies requires the evaluation of obtained observations while the user performs certain tasks and habits of the user together,CHI
 These data are used in the development process of interactive systems,CHI
" After Vannevar Bush introduced the idea of theoretical analog computer (MEMEX: memory extender) in 1945, Shackel conducted the first studies in HCI field [2]",CHI
" In 1969, a periodical magazine ""International Journal of Man-Machine Studies"" was founded, in the 1970s ""user friendly"" (user-friendliness) concept was introduced, in 1976 NATO was sponsor for the ""Man-Computer Interaction"" related workshop",CHI
"Weinberg and Shneiderman have published the first book on the subject during these years [3, 4]",CHI
 In 1982 the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) launched the of SIGCH (Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction) and CHI (International Conference for Human-Computer Interaction) conferences,CHI
" In the late 1980s, four major magazines in the field of Human-Computer Interaction were continued to be published",CHI
" During this period, the first industrial Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory was established,  in the 1990s with the development of web technologies, the importance of the HCI studies was increased and user-centered design began to come forward rather than technical/designer-centered design",CHI
" Towards the end of 90s, the first HCI academic programs have been initiated in universities such as Carnegie Mellon University, Indiana University",CHI
The world of computing has evolved really fast with passing time,CHI
" From data centres, we moved to the cloud, then to the edge and we are sure that much more is still going to come",CHI
" We got introduced to 3D printing and virtual and augmented reality applications, some of which completely changed our lives",CHI
" As discussing augmented reality, learn top trends in AR",CHI
"From the AI assistant on our phones to that speaker looking thing that can turn off the lights of your room on one single command of yours, technology has no barriers nowadays",CHI
" But in between this technical revolution we must admit that the interaction and communications with technology is not always that easy, remember getting annoyed because of your phoneâ€™s autocorrect feature? Thatâ€™s what I am talking about",CHI
 The keyboard that was not easy to communicate with was suffering from a poor Human-computer interaction design,CHI
 Do you know what it is? This blog is all about the thing mentioned above,CHI
Human-Computer Interaction(HCI),CHI
The study of how computer technology affects human labour and activities is known as Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI),CHI
" The word ""computer technology"" currently encompasses a wide range of devices, from traditional computers with displays and keyboards to smartphones, home appliances, in-car navigation systems, and even integrated sensors and actuators like automated lighting",CHI
" HCI is linked to a design field known as Interaction Design or User-Centered Design, which focuses on how to make computer technology as simple and enjoyable to use as possible",CHI
" The concept of ""usability,"" which is generally characterised in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction, is an important part of the design profession",CHI
"Because it currently encompasses practically all types of information technology, the definition of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) must remain wide (IT)",CHI
 The study of creating computers and technologies to best serve their users is known as human-computer interaction (HCI) (i,CHI
e,CHI
 humans),CHI
 HCI is closely connected to User Experience (UX) design and is widely regarded as the forerunner of this more current approach,CHI
Evolution of Human-Computer Interaction,CHI
"Since its beginning, the area of Human-Computer Interaction has expanded considerably",CHI
" To operate the early personal computers (PCs), you needed a lot of training and, predictably, there were a lot of problems in the user experience",CHI
" Simple operations like moving the mouse or erasing text faced users with never-before-seen problems, all of which posed major barriers to the computer's use",CHI
"In the early 1980s, HCI emerged as an attempt to understand how and why computers could be made more user-friendly",CHI
 The subject of research soon expanded to encompass nearly all aspects of information technology,CHI
Importance of Human-Computer Interaction,CHI
"HCI is critical since it will be necessary for goods to be more successful, safe, helpful, and functional",CHI
 It will make the user's experience more enjoyable in the long term,CHI
" As a result, having someone with HCI skills involved in all phases of any product or system development is critical",CHI
 HCI is also necessary to prevent goods or projects from failing completely,CHI
"When creating clear intuitive systems that will be accessible by people with a wide variety of talents and knowledge, as well as those who have not finished any official training, HCI is critical",CHI
 HCI makes software and gadgets more intelligible and useful for everyone by leveraging our everyday knowledge of the environment,CHI
" As everyone has used genuine paper folders in their daily lives, displaying a visual of a small folder in a computer's interface helps the user comprehend the folder's purpose",CHI
" Finally, if a system is well-designed using HCI approaches, the user should not have to worry about the system's complexities",CHI
" Clear, straightforward, and natural interaction should be the norm",CHI
"Today, technology has infiltrated every area of our life",CHI
" Even if a person does not directly own or use a computer, computers have an impact on their lives",CHI
" ATM machines, railway ticket selling machines, and hot beverage vending machines are just a few examples of computer interfaces that people may interact with on a regular basis without having to possess a computer",CHI
" When creating any of these systems or interfaces, human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial, whether designing an interface for an ATM or a desktop computer, HCI principles should be examined and taken into account to guarantee that the interface is safe, useful, and efficient",CHI
 HCI is significant for any company that relies on technology or computers in its day-to-day operations,CHI
 Staff are more content and productive when working with well-designed usable systems since they are not irritated,CHI
 HCI is particularly essential in the design of safety-critical systems like those found in power plants and air traffic control centres,CHI
" In these instances, design flaws can have catastrophic consequences, including the death of many individual",CHI
"When building systems that are not just functional but also accessible to persons with impairments, human-computer interaction (HCI) is a critical factor to consider",CHI
" HCI's basic idea is to offer everyone with secure, usable, and efficient systems, which includes people with a wide variety of abilities and levels of experience and knowledge",CHI
 Any system that is built using HCI user-centered approaches and concepts will be as accessible as possible to people with impairments,CHI
"Today, only a small percentage of computer users read the software's documentation, assuming one exists",CHI
 Only the most specialist and complex programmes need intensive training and a handbook,CHI
"Within a few minutes of engaging with a computer software, consumers expect to grasp its basic features",CHI
" HCI equips designers with the ideas, strategies, and resources they need to create intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces that don't require training",CHI
Virtual reality is an excellent example of human-computer interaction in the workplace,CHI
 The interaction between the computer and the user is meant to provide the user a new viewpoint,CHI
" Virtual reality, when done correctly, can genuinely resemble the actual environment, and is an excellent example of good HCI at action",CHI
" Voice search, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Voice Search, is another example",CHI
 These voice search apps and gadgets allow users to engage with a device or system that guides them to an Amazon purchase or a Google search,CHI
"On an end-note, if we look at the future of Human-computer interaction, we will find that the things ahead are going to be really exciting",CHI
 Looking into the possibilities of where HCI may lead us might seem like you're reading a science fiction storey,CHI
" That's because HCI wants technology to be as normal and accessible as possible in our daily lives, giving us a glimpse into an apparently futuristic future",CHI
"When utilising virtual reality, Dexta haptic gloves were created to simulate touch feelings of hardness, softness, springiness, and more",CHI
" As the user interacts with things in their VR experience, the gloves replicate these feelings by locking and unlocking the user's finger joints to various degrees",CHI
" As indicating VR applications here, learn the applications of VR in the military",CHI
Pre-touch sensing,CHI
It enables your smartphone to read your thoughts (almost),CHI
" When they first come out, pre-touch phones should be able to detect how the user holds the phone or which fingers approach the screen in order to forecast what the user intends to do",CHI
 This gives the impression that your phone can read your mind since it executes things before you give it a clear instruction,CHI
"hether you are a seasoned Designer (have webmaster in your CV) or new to the world of digital software product design (UXD, UXR, UI, IxD, IA, CX, LX, VD, FE, SO, PO, ML, AI, etc) the universe in which you can apply your craft and skills are continuing to grow",CHI
" Letâ€™s review the paradigms that construct how we think about, design for, develop in, and deploy software for people all around the globe",CHI
Human interactions options,CHI
"Human Interaction optionsIn 2021, we interact with computers like it is oxygen",CHI
" At one point not that long ago we did not interact with computers daily; however, humans are quick to invent and quick to adapt to new systems that improve their lives",CHI
" The computer has been a dominant force in our day-to-day existence, and the ways we interact with computers have changed over time",CHI
 Computers and software are fundamentally supported by the ways humans can interact with each other in the world,CHI
Sight: We use our eyes to look at screens or other user interfaces and content to make decisions to execute a task,CHI
"Touch: We use the dexterity in your hands to operate a user interface including buttons, keyboards, and feel haptic (vibrational) feedback, and more from our computer devices",CHI
Hearing: Sound is used as feedback for usage both in content (music/video) as well as to indicate actions and proprietary sounds of a user interface,CHI
"Voice: We speak to communicate actions, feelings, and commands",CHI
 Voice interfaces learn these commands and train their users to make specific commands to accomplish tasks,CHI
Spatial: We move around space both in the world and in terms of our computer systems,CHI
 Interfaces can respond to macro movements (location on the planet) vs micro-movements waving hands or thumbs up etc to control an interface,CHI
"These sensing abilities are thus enhanced and augmented by a computer allow us to see, touch, hear, speak, and move in space with greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy because of a computer",CHI
The number of hardware options is continuing to grow but the vast number of computer usage can be bucketed into 3 types,CHI
"Desktop (Monitor, Computer Tower, Keyboard, Mouse)",CHI
"Laptop (Monitor + Keyboard + Trackpad),Touch screen (Mobile/Tablet)",CHI
"Now, of course, computers are embedded into our lives in such large ways including vehicles, consumer electronics, gaming devices, and the internet of things devices",CHI
 Increasingly the distinction between what has a computer and what doesnâ€™t is harder to distinguish,CHI
Computer software categories,CHI
"Computer software has endless permutations and is deeply ingrained into every aspect of our lives from ordering food, to scheduling an event with your family",CHI
" The software can be deployed in many ways but with the proliferation of the internet and handheld computers, we are starting to see the execution of 3 types of software delivery types",CHI
 Native Platform Software â€” You might understand this as Apple vs PC and software that is made just for those ecosystems and operating systems,CHI
Hybrid Cloud Software â€” Large enterprise SaaS companies are adopting this strategy to tackle both the complexity of security as well as stand up their existing business models,CHI
" Companies like IBM, Deloitte, and Oracle all use some version of hybrid deployment of software and data protection",CHI
 Cloud Software/Browser-Software â€” With high-speed internet and improved internet browsers software doesnâ€™t require being locked in your individual computer rather it can be managed and executed in the cloud and a software user can access the software from any internet-connected computer,CHI
" Companies like Figma, Google Docs, and Salesforce, etc all create software through the browser",CHI
Software is what elevates our computers to the level of utility,CHI
" From google maps to banking software allows us to go places, buy things, and keep the systems moving and our societies humming",CHI
 Software at the minimum should be usable,CHI
 When software is done well it is also accessible to all users and when it is really good it is a delightful user experience for all its users,CHI
 The goal of anyone making software should be to make what their users actually want,CHI
" Easier said than done but if we fundamentally hold that software is for humanâ€™s then we should make sure our software is infused with humanity from research to UX to the user interface, and through to the data that is gathered",CHI
Computer Artificial Intelligence,CHI
Categories of Artificial Intelligence,CHI
"Computer software has a huge impact on making our hardware useful, usable, accessible, and hopefully delightful",CHI
 This has also lead to improved computer processing power which has ushered in the scalability of artificial intelligence,CHI
" AI software is used to manage, crunch, and make sense of large amounts of data as well as other applications",CHI
" AI can be integrated into existing software tools like auto-correct or spell check or can be autonomous systems like robots or chatbots, or automated customer service emails, etc",CHI
 AI can be bucketing into 5 branches within computer science and is a rapidly growing field,CHI
Natural Language Processing (NLP)â€” The ability to give computers the ability to understand the text and speak words in much the same way human beings can,CHI
" Products like Alexa, Siri, or Google Translate all rely on being able to intake voice and produce a result",CHI
"Humans, computers, and artificial intelligence should be leaned on for what they do best",CHI
" Allow humans to focus on creativity, design, communication, and value",CHI
" Allow computers to focus on computation, processes, and data collections",CHI
 Allow AI to focus on mining the data and making processes more efficient,CHI
 By focusing on these and many other aspects it will allow the vast set of skilled humans who build these systems to be more creative,CHI
 Our complex systems can hopefully be designed to free up skilled humans to tackle even more difficult problems,CHI
" From a cure for cancer to climate modeling, our ability to integrate and utilize computer paradigms will continue to support and require highly skilled professionals as the engine that drives its success and ability to continue to change our world",CHI
"Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI), alternatively manâ€“machine interaction (MMI) or computerâ€“human interaction (CHI) is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers",CHI
" With today's technology and tools, and our motivation to create really effective and usable interfaces and screens, why do we continue to produce systems that are inefficient and confusing or, at worst, just plain unusable? Is it because: 1",CHI
 We don't care? 2,CHI
 We don't possess common sense? 3,CHI
 We don't have the time? 4,CHI
 We still don't know what really makes good design? DEFINITION ,CHI
"Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them. GOALS ",CHI
A basic goal of HCI is â€“ to improve the interactions between users and computers â€“ by making computers more usable and receptive to the user's needs,CHI
  A long term goal of HCI is â€“ to design systems that minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they want â€“ to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's task WHY IS HCI IMPORTANT ,CHI
 User-centered design is getting a crucial role! ,CHI
" It is getting more important today to increase competitiveness via HCI studies (Norman, 1990) ",CHI
 High-cost e-transformation investments ,CHI
 Users lose time with badly designed products and services ,CHI
Users even give up using bad interface â€“ Ineffective allocation of resources 3 DEFINING THE USER INTERFACE ,CHI
" User interface, design is a subset of a field of study called human-computer interaction (HCI)",CHI
"  Human-computer interaction is the study, planning, and design of how people and computers work together so that a person's needs are satisfied in the most effective way",CHI
" HCI designers must consider a variety of factors: â€“ what people want and expect, physical limitations and abilities people possess, --how information processing systems work, â€“ what people find enjoyable and attractive",CHI
 â€“ Technical characteristics and limitations of the computer hardware and software must also be considered,CHI
"  The user interface is to â€“ the part of a computer and its software that people can see, hear, touch, talk to, or otherwise understand or direct",CHI
 The user interface has essentially two components: input and output,CHI
 â€¢ Input is how a person communicates his / her needs to the computer,CHI
" â€“ Some common input components are the keyboard, mouse, trackball, one's finger, and one's voice",CHI
  Output is how the computer conveys the results of its computations and requirements to the user,CHI
" â€“ Today, the most common computer output mechanism is the display screen, followed by mechanisms that take advantage of a person's auditory capabilities: voice and sound",CHI
  The use of the human senses of smell and touch output in interface design still remain largely unexplored,CHI
" â€¢ Proper interface design will provide a mix of well-designed input and output mechanisms that satisfy the user's needs, capabilities, and limitations in the most effective way possible",CHI
" â€¢ The best interface is one that it not noticed, one that permits the user to focus on the information and task at hand, not the mechanisms used to present the information and perform the task",CHI
" 4 THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD DESIGN With today's technology and tools, and our motivation to create really effective and usable interfaces and screens, why do we continue to produce systems that are inefficient and confusing or, at worst, just plain unusable? Is it because: We don't care? We don't possess common sense? ",CHI
 We don't have the time? ,CHI
We still don't know what really makes good design? ,CHI
" But we never seem to have time to find out what makes good design, nor to properly apply it",CHI
" After all, many of us have other things to do in addition to designing interfaces and screens",CHI
  So we take our best shot given the workload and time constraints imposed upon us,CHI
" The result, too often, is woefully inadequate",CHI
" â€¢ Interface and screen design were really a matter of common sense, we developers would have been producing almost identical screens for representing the real world",CHI
 â€¢ Example bad designs â€“ Closed door with complete wood â€“ suggestion : glass door THE IMPORTANCE OF THE USER INTERFACE  A well-designed interface and screen is terribly important to our users,CHI
 It is theirïƒک window to view the capabilities of the system,CHI
  It is also the vehicle through which many critical tasks are presented,CHI
" These tasksïƒک often have a direct impact on an organization's relations with its customers, and its profitability",CHI
  A screen's layout and appearance affect a person in a variety of ways,CHI
" If they areïƒک confusing and inefficient, people will have greater difficulty in doing their jobs and will make more mistakes",CHI
  Poor design may even chase some people away from a system permanently,CHI
" It canïƒک also lead to aggravation, frustration, and increased stress",CHI
 The Benefits of Good Design  Poor clarity forced screen users to spend one extra second per screen,CHI
ïƒک o Almost one additional year would be required to process all screens,CHI
 o Twenty extra seconds in screen usage time adds an additional 14 person years,CHI
 5  The benefits of a well designed screen have also been under experimental scrutinyïƒک for many years,CHI
" o One researcher, for example, attempted to improve screen clarity and readability by making screens less crowded",CHI
" o Separate items, which had been combined on the same display line to conserve space, were placed on separate lines instead",CHI
 o The result screen users were about 20 percent more productive with the less crowded version,CHI
  Proper formatting of information on screens does have a significant positive effectïƒک on performance,CHI
" o In recent years, the productivity benefits of well-designed Web pages have also been scrutinized",CHI
  Training costs are lowered because training time is reduced,CHI
 support line costs are lowered because fewer assist calls are necessary,CHI
Employee satisfaction is increased because aggravation and frustration are reduced,CHI
  Identifying and resolving problems during the design and development process alsoïƒک has significant economic benefits  How many screens are used each day in our technological world?ïƒک  How many screens are used each day in your organization?

" Proper screen design might also, of course, lower theïƒک costs of replacing ""broken"" PCs",CHI
 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACE The need for people to communicate with each other has existed since we first walked upon this planet,CHI
  The lowest and most common level of communication modes we share are movements and gestures,CHI
" Movements and gestures are language independent, that is, they permit people who do not speak the same language to deal with one another",CHI
" 6  The next higher level, in terms of universality and complexity, is spoken language",CHI
" Most people can speak one language, some two or more",CHI
 A spoken language is a very efficient mode of communication if both parties to the communication understand it,CHI
 At the third and highest level of complexity is written language,CHI
" While most people speak, not all can write",CHI
"But for those who can, writing is still nowhere near as efficient a means of communication as speaking",CHI
"  In modem times, we have the typewriter, another step upward in communication complexity",CHI
 Significantly fewer people type than write,CHI
" (While a practiced typist can find typing faster and more efficient than handwriting, the unskilled may not find this the case",CHI
" Spoken language, however, is still more efficient than typing, regardless' of typing skill level",CHI
"  Through its first few decades, a computer's ability to deal with human communication was inversely related to what was easy for people to do",CHI
" o The computer demanded rigid, typed input through a keyboard; people responded slowly using this device and with varying degrees of skill",CHI
" o The human-computer dialog reflected the computer's preferences, consisting of one style or a combination of styles using keyboards, commonly referred to as Command Language, Question and Answer, Menu selection, Function Key Selection, and Form Fill-In",CHI
" â€¢ Throughout the computer's history, designers have been developing, with varying degrees of success, other human-computer interaction methods that utilize more general, widespread, and easier-to-learn capabilities: voice and handwriting",CHI
"  Systems that recognize human speech and handwriting now exist,ï‚§ although they still lack the universality and richness of typed input",CHI
 INTRODUCTION OF THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE ,CHI
" The Xerox systems, Altus and STAR, introduced the mouse and pointing and selecting as the primary human-computer communication method",CHI
"  The user simply pointed at the screen, using the mouse as an intermediary",CHI
" 7  These systems also introduced the graphical user interface as we know it a new concept was born, revolutionizing the human-computer interface",CHI
" A BRIEF HISTORY OF SCREEN DESIGN â€¢ While developers have been designing screens since a cathode ray tube display was first attached to a computer, more widespread interest in the application of good design principles to screens did not begin to emerge until the early 1970s, when IBM introduced its 3270 cathode ray tube text-based terminal",CHI
 â€¢ A 1970s screen often resembled the one pictured in Figure,CHI
 It usually consisted of many fields (more than are illustrated here) with very cryptic and often unintelligible captions,CHI
" â€¢ It was visually cluttered, and often possessed a command field that challenged the user to remember what had to be keyed into it",CHI
  Ambiguous messages often required referral to a manual to interpret,CHI
  Effectively using this kind of screen required a great deal of practice and patience,CHI
" Most early screens were monochromatic, typically presenting green text on black backgrounds",CHI
" At the turn of the decade guidelines for text-based screen design were finally made widely available and many screens began to take on a much less cluttered look through concepts such as grouping and alignment of elements, as illustrated in Figure 1",CHI
2,CHI
" 8 â€¢ User memory was supported by providing clear and meaningful field captions and by listing commands on the screen, and enabling them to be applied, through function keys",CHI
 Messages also became clearer,CHI
" â€¢ These screens were not entirely clutter-free, however",CHI
 Instructions and reminders to the user had to be inscribed on the screen in the form of prompts or completion aids such as the codes PR and Sc,CHI
" â€¢ Not all 1980s screens looked like this, however",CHI
" In the 1980s, 1970s-type screens were still being designed, and many still reside in systems today",CHI
"  The advent of graphics yielded another milestone in the evolution of screen design, as illustrated in Figure above While some basic ""design principles did not change, groupings and alignment, for example, Borders were made available to visually enhance groupings and buttons and menus for implementing commands replaced function keys",CHI
" 9 â€¢ Multiple properties of elements were also provided, including many different font sizes and styles, line thicknesses, and colors",CHI
" â€¢ The entry field was supplemented by a multitude of other kinds of controls, including list boxes, drop-down combination boxes, spin boxes, and so forth",CHI
" â€¢ These new controls were much more effective in supporting a person's memory, now simply allowing for selection from a list instead of requiring a remembered key entry",CHI
" â€¢ Completion aids disappeared from screens, replaced by one of the new listing controls",CHI
" Screens could also be simplified, the much more powerful computers being able to quickly present a new screen",CHI
 EARLIER DIRECT MANIPULATION SYSTEMS o The concept of direct manipulation actually preceded the first graphical system,CHI
 The earliest full-screen text editors possessed similar characteristics,CHI
 o Screens of text resembling a piece of paper on one's desk could be created (extension of real world) and then reviewed in their entirety (continuous visibility),CHI
 o Editing or restructuring could be easily accomplished (through rapid incremental actions) and the results immediately seen,CHI
 o Actions could be reversed when necessary,CHI
" It took the advent of graphical systems to crystallize the direct manipulation concept, however",CHI
" INDIRECT MANIPULATION In practice, direct manipulation of all screen objects and actions may not be feasible because of the following: 13 The operation may be difficult to conceptualize in the graphical system",CHI
  The graphics capability of the system may be limited,CHI
  The amount of space available for placing manipulation controls in the window border may be limited,CHI
  It may be difficult for people to learn and remember all the necessary operations and actions,CHI
"  When this occurs, indirect manipulation is provided",CHI
" Indirect manipulation substitutes words and text, such as pull-down or pop-up menus, for symbols, and substitutes typing for pointing",CHI
  Most window systems are a combination of both direct and indirect manipulation,CHI
 A menu may be accessed by pointing at a menu icon and then selecting it (direct manipulation),CHI
"  The menu itself, however, is a textual list of operations (indirect manipulation)",CHI
" When an operation is selected from the list, by pointing or typing, the system executes it as a command",CHI
"  Which style of interaction-direct manipulation, indirect manipulation, or a combination of both-is best, under what conditions and for whom, remains a question whose answer still eludes us",CHI
 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE A graphical system possesses a set of defining concepts,CHI
" Included are sophisticated visual Presentation, pick-and click interaction, a restricted set of interface options, visualization, object orientation, extensive use of a person's recognition memory, and concurrent performance of functions Sophisticated Visual Presentation: Visual presentation is the visual aspect of the interface",CHI
 It is what people see on the screen,CHI
" The sophistication of a graphical system permits displaying lines, including drawings and icons",CHI
"  It also permits the displaying of a variety of character fonts, including different sizes and styles",CHI
 The display of 16 million or more colors is possible on some screens,CHI
 Graphics also permit animation and the presentation of photograph and motion video,CHI
" 14 The meaningful interface elements visually presented to the user in a graphical System include windows (primary, secondary, or dialog boxes), menus (menu bar, pull down, popup, cascading), icons to represent objects such as programs or files, assorted screen-based controls (text boxes, list boxes, combination boxes, settings, scroll bar and buttons), and a mouse pointer and cursor",CHI
" -- The objective is to reflect visually on screen the real world of the user as realistically, meaningfully, simply, and clearly possible",CHI
 A graphical system possesses a set of defining concepts,CHI
" Included are sophisticated visual presentation, pick-andclick interaction, a restricted set of interface options, visualization, object orientation, extensive use of a person's recognition memory, and concurrent performance of functions",CHI
" Restricted Set of Interface Options: The array of alternatives available to the user is what is presented on the screen or may be retrieved through what is presented on the screen, nothing less, nothing more",CHI
 This concept fostered the acronym WYSIWYG,CHI
 Pick-and-Click Interaction: Elements of a graphical screen upon which some action is to be performed must first identified,CHI
" o The motor activity required of a person to identify this element for a proposed action is commonly referred to as pick, the signal to perform an action as cue",CHI
 o The primary mechanism for performing this pick-and-click is most often the mouse and its buttons,CHI
 o The user moves the mouse pointer to the relevant element (pick) and the action is signaled (click),CHI
 o Pointing allows rapid selection and feedback,CHI
 The hand and mind seem to work smoothly and efficiently together,CHI
 o The secondary mechanism for performing these selection actions is the keyboard most systems permit pick-and-click to be performed using the keyboard as well,CHI
 Visualization: Visualization is a cognitive process that allows people to understand ,CHI
"Information that is difficult to perceive, because it is either too voluminous or too abstract Presenting specialized graphic portrayals facilitates visualization",CHI
 The best visualization method for an activity depends on what People are trying to learn from the data,CHI
" 15 The goal is not necessarily to reproduce a really graphical image, but to produce one that conveys the most relevant information",CHI
" Effective visualizations can facilitate mental insights, increase productivity, and for faster and more accurate use of data",CHI
 Object Orientation: A graphical system consists of objects and actions,CHI
 Objects are what people see on screen,CHI
 They are manipulated as a single unit,CHI
  Objects can be composed of sub objects,CHI
" For example, an object may be a document",CHI
" The document's sub objects may be a paragraph, sentence, word, and letter",CHI
  A collection is the simplest relationship-the objects sharing a common aspect,CHI
  A collection might be the result of a query or a multiple selection of objects,CHI
 Operations can be applied to a collection of objects,CHI
  A constraint is a stronger object relationship,CHI
 Changing an object in a set affects some other object in the set,CHI
  A document being organized into pages is an example of a constraint,CHI
 A composite exists when the relationship between objects becomes so significant that the aggregation itself can be identified as an object,CHI
"  Examples include a range of cells organized into a spreadsheet, or a collection of words organized into a paragraph",CHI
 A container is an object in which other objects exist,CHI
 Examples include text in a document  or documents in a folder,CHI
 A container often influences the behavior of its content,CHI
" It may add or suppress certain properties or operations of objects placed within it, control access to its content, or control access to kinds of objects it will accept",CHI
 These relationships help define an object's type,CHI
 Similar traits and behaviors exist in objects of the same object type,CHI
 Another important object characteristic is persistence,CHI
 Persistence is the maintenance of a state once it is established,CHI
" An object's state (for example, window size, cursor location, scroll position, and so on) should always be automatically preserved when the user changes it",CHI
 16 Use of Recognition Memory: Continuous visibility of objects and actions encourages use of a person's more powerful recognition memory,CHI
" The ""out of sight, out of mind"" problem is eliminated CONCURRENT PERFORMANCE OF FUNCTIONS Graphic systems may do two or more things at one time",CHI
 Multiple programs may run simultaneously,CHI
" When a system is not busy on a primary task, it may process background tasks (cooperative multitasking)",CHI
"When applications are running as truly separate tasks, the system may divide the processing power into time slices and allocate portions to each application",CHI
 Data may also be transferred between programs,CHI
" It may be temporarily stored on a ""clipboard"" for later transfer or be automatically swapped between programs",CHI
 THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE  A user interface is a collection of techniques and mechanisms to interact with something,CHI
  In a graphical interface the primary interaction mechanism is a pointing device of some kind,CHI
  This device is the electronic equivalent to the human hand,CHI
 What the user interacts with is a collection of elements referred to as objects,CHI
"  They can be seen, heard, touched, or otherwise perceived",CHI
  Objects are always visible to the user and are used to perform tasks,CHI
 They are interacted with as entities independent of all other objects,CHI
"People perform operations, called actions, on objects",CHI
" The operations include accessing and modifying objects by pointing, selecting, and manipulating",CHI
 All objects have standard resulting behaviors,CHI
 THE WEB USER INTERFACE The expansion of the World Wide Web since the early 1990s has been truly amazing,CHI
" Once simply a communication medium for scientists and researchers, its many and pervasive tentacles have spread deeply into businesses, organizations, and homes around the world",CHI
" Unlike earlier text-based and GUI systems that were developed and nurtured in an organization's Data Processing and Information Systems groups, the Web's roots were sown in a market-driven society thirsting for convenience and information",CHI
 Web interface design is essentially the design of navigation and the presentation of information,CHI
" It is about content, not data",CHI
" Proper interface design is largely a matter of properly balancing the structure and relationships of menus, content, and other linked documents or graphics",CHI
" The design goal is 17 to build a hierarchy of menus and pages that feels natural, is well structured, is easy to use, and is truthful",CHI
" The Web is a navigation environment where people move between pages of information, not an application environment",CHI
 It is also a graphically rich environment,CHI
 Web interface design is difficult for a number of reasons,CHI
" First, its underlying design language, HTML, was never intended for creating screens to be used by the general population",CHI
 Its scope of users was expected to be technical,CHI
 HTML was limited in objects and interaction styles and did not provide a means for presenting information in the most effective way for people,CHI
" Next, browser navigation retreated to the pre-GUI era",CHI
" This era was characterized by a ""command"" field whose contents had to be learned, and a navigational organization and structure that lay hidden beneath a mostly dark and blank screen",CHI
" GUIs eliminated the absolute necessity for a command field, providing menus related to the task and the current contextual situation",CHI
" Browser navigation is mostly confined to a ""Back"" and ""Forward"" concept, but ""back-to where"" and ""forward-towhere"" is often unremembered or unknown",CHI
" Web interface design is also more difficult because the main issues concern information Architecture and task flow, neither of which is easy to standardize",CHI
" It is more difficult because of the availability of the various types of multimedia, and the desire of many designers to use something simply because it is available",CHI
" It is more difficult because users are ill defined, and the user's tools so variable in nature",CHI
" The ultimate goal of a Web that feels natural, is well structured, and is easy to use will reach fruition",CHI
" THE POPULARITY OF THE WEB While the introduction of the graphical user interface revolutionized the user interface, the Web has revolutionized computing",CHI
" It allows millions of people scattered across the globe to communicate, access information, publish, and be heard",CHI
 â€¢ It allows people to control much of the display and the rendering of Web pages,CHI
" 18 Aspects such as typography and colors can be changed, graphics turned off, and decisions made whether or not to transmit certain data over non secure channels or whether to accept or refuse cookies",CHI
 Web usage has reflected this popularity,CHI
" The number of Internet hosts has risen dramatically:  In 1984, hosts online exceeded 1,000;  in 1987, 10,000;  in 1989, 100,000,  in 1990, 300,000; in 1992 hosts exceeded one million",CHI
  Commercialization of the Internet saw even greater expansion of the growth rate,CHI
" In 1993, Internet traffic was expanding at a 341,634 percent annual growth rate",CHI
" In 1996, there were nearly 10 million hosts online and 40 million connected people (PBS Timeline)",CHI
  User control has had some decided disadvantages for some Web site owners as well,CHI
  Users have become much more discerning about good design,CHI
" Slow download times, confusing navigation, confusing page organization, disturbing animation, or other undesirable site features often results in user abandonment of the site for others with a more agreeable interface",CHI
"  People are quick to vote with their mouse, and these warnings should not go unheeded",CHI
 GUI VERSUS WEB PAGE DESIGN,CHI
"The syntax, or form, of the elements of a language has a significant effect on the readability of programs",PL
 Following are some examples of syntactic design choices that affect readability: ,PL
Special words,PL
" Program appearance and thus program readability are strongly influenced by the forms of a languageâ€™s special words (for example, while, class, and for)",PL
" Especially important is the method of forming compound statements, or statement groups, primarily in control constructs",PL
 Some languages have used matching pairs of special words or symbols to form groups,PL
 C and its descendants use braces to specify compound statements,PL
" All of these languages suffer because statement groups are always terminated in the same way, which makes it difficult to determine which group is being ended when an end or a right brace appears",PL
 Fortran 95 and Ada make this clearer by using a distinct closing syntax for each type of statement group,PL
" For example, Ada uses end if to terminate a selection construct and end loop to terminate a loop construct",PL
" This is an example of the conflict between simplicity that results in fewer reserved words, as in C++, and the greater readability that can result from using more reserved words, as in Ada",PL
 Another important issue is whether the special words of a language can be used as names for program variables,PL
" If so, the resulting programs can be very confusing",PL
" For example, in Fortran 95, special words, such as Do and End, are legal variable names, so the appearance of these words in a program may or may not connote something special",PL
  Form and meaning,PL
 Designing statements so that their appearance at least partially indicates their purpose is an obvious aid to readability,PL
" Semantics, or meaning, should follow directly from syntax, or form",PL
" In some cases, this principle is violated by two language constructs that are identical or similar in appearance but have different meanings, depending perhaps on context",PL
" In C, for example, the meaning of the reserved word static depends on the context of its appearance",PL
" If used on the definition of a variable inside a function, it means the variable is created at compile time",PL
" If used on the definition of a variable that is outside all functions, it means the variable is visible only in the file in which its definition appears; that is, it is not exported from that file",PL
" One of the primary complaints about the shell commands of UNIX (Raymond, 2004) is that their appearance does not always suggest their function",PL
" For example, the meaning of the UNIX command grep can be deciphered only through prior knowledge, or perhaps cleverness and familiarity with the UNIX editor, ed",PL
 The appearance of grep connotes nothing to UNIX beginners,PL
" (In ed, the command /regular_expression/ searches for a substring that matches the regular expression",PL
" Preceding this with g makes it a global command, specifying that the scope of the search is the whole file being edited",PL
 Following the command with p specifies that lines with the matching substring are to be printed,PL
" So g/regular_expression/p, which can obviously be abbreviated as grep, prints all lines in a file that contain substrings that match the regular expression",PL
 The basic architecture of computers has had a profound effect on language design,PL
" Most of the popular languages of the past 50 years have been designed around the prevalent computer architecture, called the von Neumann architecture, after one of its originators, John von Neumann (pronounced â€œvon Noymanâ€‌)",PL
 These languages are called imperative languages,PL
" In a von Neumann computer, both data and programs are stored in the same memory",PL
" The central processing unit (CPU), which executes instructions, is separate from the memory",PL
" Therefore, instructions and data must be transmitted, or piped, from memory to the CPU",PL
 Results of operations in the CPU must be moved back to memory,PL
 Nearly all digital computers built since the 1940s have been based on the von Neumann architecture,PL
" Because of the von Neumann architecture, the central features of imperative languages are variables, which model the memory cells; assignment statements, which are based on the piping operation; and the iterative form of repetition, which is the most efficient way to implement repetition on this architecture",PL
" Operands in expressions are piped from memory to the CPU, and the result of evaluating the expression is piped back to the memory cell represented by the left side of the assignment",PL
 Iteration is fast on von Neumann computers because instructions are stored in adjacent cells of memory and repeating the execution of a section of code requires only a branch instruction,PL
" This efficiency discourages the use of recursion for repetition, although recursion is sometimes more natural",PL
 The execution of a machine code program on a von Neumann architecture computer occurs in a process called the fetch-execute cycle,PL
" As stated earlier, programs reside in memory but are executed in the CPU",PL
 Each instruction to be executed must be moved from memory to the processor,PL
 The address of the next instruction to be executed is maintained in a register called the program counter,PL
" Another kind of language, the visual language, is a subcategory of the imperative languages",PL
 The most popular visual languages are the ,PL
NET languages,PL
 These languages (or their implementations) include capabilities for drag-and-drop generation of code segments,PL
" Such languages were once called fourth-generation languages, although that name has fallen out of use",PL
 The visual languages provide a simple way to generate graphical user interfaces to programs,PL
" For example, using Visual Studio to develop software in the ",PL
"NET languages, the code to produce a display of a form control, such as a button or text box, can be created with a single keystroke",PL
 These capabilities are now available in all of the ,PL
NET languages,PL
 Some authors refer to scripting languages as a separate category of programming languages,PL
" However, languages in this category are bound together more by their implementation method, partial or full interpretation, than by a common language design",PL
" The languages that are typically called scripting languages, among them Perl, JavaScript, and Ruby, are imperative languages in every sense",PL
 A logic programming language is an example of a rule-based language,PL
" In an imperative language, an algorithm is specified in great detail, and the specific order of execution of the instructions or statements must be included",PL
" In a rule-based language, however, rules are specified in no particular order, and the language implementation system must choose an order in which the rules are used to produce the desired result",PL
 This approach to software development is radically different from those used with the other two categories of languages and clearly requires a completely different kind of language,PL
" Prolog, the most commonly used logic programming language, and logic programming are discussed",PL
 The programming language evaluation criteria described in Section 1,PL
3 provide a framework for language design,PL
" Unfortunately, that framework is self-contradictory",PL
" In his insightful paper on language design, Hoare (1973) stated that â€œthere are so many important but conflicting criteria, that their reconciliation and satisfaction is a major engineering task",PL
â€‌ Two criteria that conflict are reliability and cost of execution,PL
" For example, the Java language definition demands that all references to array elements be checked to ensure that the index or indices are in their legal ranges",PL
 This step adds a great deal to the cost of execution of Java programs that contain large numbers of references to array elements,PL
" C does not require index range checking, so C programs execute faster than semantically equivalent Java programs, although Java programs are more reliable",PL
 The designers of Java traded execution efficiency for reliability,PL
" As another example of conflicting criteria that leads directly to design trade-offs, consider the case of APL",PL
 APL includes a powerful set of operators for array operands,PL
" Because of the large number of operators, a significant number of new symbols had to be included in APL to represent the operators",PL
" Also, many APL operators can be used in a single, long, complex expression",PL
" One result of this high degree of expressivity is that, for applications involving many array operations, APL is very writable",PL
" Indeed, a huge amount of computation can be specified in a very small program",PL
 Another result is that APL programs have very poor readability,PL
 A compact and concise expression has a certain mathematical beauty but it is difficult for anyone other than the programmer to understand,PL
 Well-known author Daniel McCracken (1970) once noted that it took him four hours to read and understand a four-line APL program,PL
 The designer of APL traded readability for writability,PL
 The conflict between writability and reliability is a common one in language design,PL
" The pointers of C++ can be manipulated in a variety of ways, which supports highly flexible addressing of data",PL
" Because of the potential reliability problems with pointers, they are not included in Java",PL
" Examples of conflicts among language design (and evaluation) criteria abound; some are subtle, others are obvious",PL
 It is therefore clear that the task of choosing constructs and features when designing a programming language requires many compromises and trade-offs,PL
 The machine language of the computer is its set of instructions,PL
" In the absence of other supporting software, its own machine language is the only language that most hardware computers â€œunderstand",PL
"â€‌ Theoretically, a computer could be designed and built with a particular high-level language as its machine language, but it would be very complex and expensive",PL
" Furthermore, it would be highly inflexible, because it would be difficult (but not impossible) to use it with other high-level languages",PL
 The more practical machine design choice implements in hardware a very low-level language that provides the most commonly needed primitive operations and requires system software to create an interface to programs in higher-level languages,PL
 A language implementation system cannot be the only software on a computer,PL
" Also required is a large collection of programs, called the operating system, which supplies higher-level primitives than those of the machine language",PL
" These primitives provide system resource management, input and output operations, a file management system, text and/or program editors, and a variety of other commonly needed functions",PL
" Because language implementation systems need many of the operating system facilities, they interface with the operating system rather than directly with the processor (in machine language)",PL
 The operating system and language implementations are layered over the machine language interface of a computer,PL
" These layers can be thought of as virtual computers, providing interfaces to the user at higher levels",PL
" For example, an operating system and a C compiler provide a virtual C computer",PL
" With other compilers, a machine can become other kinds of virtual computers",PL
 Most computer systems provide several different virtual computers,PL
 User programs form another layer over the top of the layer of virtual computers,PL
 The layered view of a computer is shown in Figure 1,PL
2,PL
" The implementation systems of the first high-level programming languages, constructed in the late 1950s, were among the most complex software systems of that time",PL
" In the 1960s, intensive research efforts were made to understand and formalize the process of constructing these high-level language implementations",PL
" The greatest success of those efforts was in the area of syntax analysis, primarily because that part of the implementation process is an application of parts of automata theory and formal language theory that were then well understood",PL
" ML (MetaLanguage; Ullman, 1998) was originally designed in the 1980s by Robin Milner at the University of Edinburgh as a metalanguage for a program verification system named Logic for Computable Functions (LCF; Milner et al",PL
", 1990)",PL
" ML is primarily a functional language, but it also supports imperative programming",PL
" Unlike LISP and Scheme, the type of every variable and expression in ML can be determined at compile time",PL
 Types are associated with objects rather than names,PL
 Types of names and expressions are inferred from their context,PL
" Unlike LISP and Scheme, ML does not use the parenthesized functional syntax that originated with lambda expressions",PL
" Rather, the syntax of ML resembles that of the imperative languages, such as Java and C++",PL
" Miranda was developed by David Turner (1986) at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England, in the early 1980s",PL
" Miranda is based partly on the languages ML, SASL, and KRC",PL
" Haskell (Hudak and Fasel, 1992) is based in large part on Miranda",PL
" Like Miranda, it is a purely functional language, having no variables and no assignment statement",PL
 Another distinguishing characteristic of Haskell is its use of lazy evaluation,PL
 This means that no expression is evaluated until its value is required,PL
 This leads to some surprising capabilities in the language,PL

 ALGOL 60 was the result of efforts to design a universal programming language for scientific applications,PL
" By late 1954, the Laning and Zierler algebraic system had been in operation for over a year, and the first report on Fortran had been published",PL
" Fortran became a reality in 1957, and several other high-level languages were being developed",PL
" Most notable among them were IT, which was designed by Alan Perlis at Carnegie Tech, and two languages for the UNIVAC computers, MATH-MATIC and UNICODE",PL
 The proliferation of languages made program sharing among users difficult,PL
" Furthermore, the new languages were all growing up around single architectures, some for UNIVAC computers and some for IBM 700-series machines",PL
" In response to this blossoming of machine-dependent languages, several major computer user groups in the United States, including SHARE (the IBM scientific user group) and USE (UNIVAC Scientific Exchange, the large-scale UNIVAC scientific user group), submitted a petition to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) on May 10, 1957, to form a committee to study and recommend action to create a machine-independent scientific programming language",PL

" The Smalltalk world is populated by nothing but objects, from integer constants to large complex software systems",PL
 All computing in Smalltalk is done by the same uniform technique: sending a message to an object to invoke one of its methods,PL
" A reply to a message is an object, which either returns the requested information or simply notifies the sender that the requested processing has been completed",PL
" The fundamental difference between a message and a subprogram call is this: A message is sent to a data object, specifically to one of the methods defined for the object",PL
" The called method is then executed, often modifying the data of the object to which the message was sent; a subprogram call is a message to the code of a subprogram",PL
 Usually the data to be processed by the subprogram is sent to it as a parameter,PL
"13 In Smalltalk, object abstractions are classes, which are very similar to the classes of SIMULA 67",PL
 Instances of the class can be created and are then the objects of the program,PL
" The syntax of Smalltalk is unlike that of most other programming language, in large part because of the use of messages, rather than arithmetic and logic expressions and conventional control statements",PL
 One of the Smalltalk control constructs is illustrated in the example in the next subsection,PL
 Smalltalk has done a great deal to promote two separate aspects of computing: graphical user interfaces and object-oriented programming,PL
 The windowing systems that are now the dominant method of user interfaces to software systems grew out of Smalltalk,PL
" Today, the most significant software design methodologies and programming languages are object oriented",PL
" Although the origin of some of the ideas of object-oriented languages came from SIMULA 67, they reached maturation in Smalltalk",PL
 It is clear that Smalltalkâ€™s impact on the computing world is extensive and will be long-lived,PL
" The Go programming language is not directly related to C++, although it is C-based",PL
 It is in this section in part because it does not deserve its own section and it does not fit elsewhere,PL
" Go was designed by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer at Google",PL
" Thompson is the designer of the predecessor of C, B, as well as the codesigner with Dennis Ritchie of UNIX",PL
 He and Pike were both formerly employed at Bell Labs,PL
 The initial design was begun in 2007 and the first implementation was released in late 2009,PL
 One of the initial motivations for Go was the slowness of compilation of large C++ programs at Google,PL
 One of the characteristics of the initial compiler for Go is that is it extremely fast,PL
 The Go language borrows some of its syntax and constructs from C,PL
 Some of the new features of Go include the following: (1) Data declarations are syntactically reversed from the other C-based languages; (2) the variables precede the type name; (3) variable declarations can be given a type by inference if the variable is given an initial value; and (4) functions can return multiple values,PL
" Go does not support traditional object-oriented programming, as it has no form of inheritance",PL
" However, methods can be defined for any type",PL
 It also does not have generics,PL
" The control statements of Go are similar to those of other C-based languages, although the switch does not include the implicit fall through to the next segment",PL
" Go includes a goto statement, pointers, associative arrays, interfaces (though they are different from those of Java and C#), and support for concurrency using its goroutines",PL
" Javaâ€™s designers started with C++, removed some constructs, changed some, and added a few others",PL
" The resulting language provides much of the power and flexibility of C++, but in a smaller, simpler, and safer language",PL
" Java, like many programming languages, was designed for an application for which there appeared to be no satisfactory existing language",PL
" In 1990, Sun Microsystems determined there was a need for a programming language for embedded consumer electronic devices, such as toasters, microwave ovens, and interactive TV systems",PL
 Reliability was one of the primary goals for such a language,PL
 It may not seem that reliability would be an important factor in the software for a microwave oven,PL
" If an oven had malfunctioning software, it probably would not pose a grave danger to anyone and most likely would not lead to large legal settlements",PL
" However, if the software in a particular model was found to be erroneous after a million units had been manufactured and sold, their recall would entail significant cost",PL
" Therefore, reliability is an important characteristic of the software in consumer electronic products",PL
" Delphi (Lischner, 2000) is a hybrid language, similar to C++ and Objetive-C in that it was created by adding object-oriented support, among other things, to an existing imperative language, in this case Pascal",PL
 Many of the differences between C++ and Delphi are a result of the predecessor languages and the surrounding programming cultures from which they are derived,PL
" Because C is a powerful but potentially unsafe language, C++ also fits that description, at least in the areas of array subscript range checking, pointer arithmetic, and its numerous type coercions",PL
" Likewise, because Pascal is more elegant and safer than C, Delphi is more elegant and safer than C++",PL
 Delphi is also less complex than C++,PL
" For example, Delphi does not allow user-defined operator overloading, generic subprograms, and parameterized classes, all of which are part of C++",PL
" Delphi, like Visual C++, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to the developer and simple ways to create GUI interfaces to applications written in Delphi",PL
" Delphi was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, who had previously developed the Turbo Pascal system",PL
 Both of these were marketed and distributed by Borland,PL
 Hejlsberg was also the lead designer of C#,PL
" As we stated previously, Java is based on C++ but it was specifically designed to be smaller, simpler, and more reliable",PL
" Like C++, Java has both classes and primitive types",PL
" Java arrays are instances of a predefined class, whereas in C++ they are not, although many C++ users build wrapper classes for arrays to add features like index range checking, which is implicit in Java",PL
" Java does not have pointers, but its reference types provide some of the capabilities of pointers",PL
 These references are used to point to class instances,PL
 All objects are allocated on the heap,PL
" References are always implicitly dereferenced, when necessary",PL
 So they behave more like ordinary scalar variables,PL
" Java has a primitive Boolean type named boolean, used mainly for the control expressions of its control statements (such as if and while)",PL
" Unlike C and C++, arithmetic expressions cannot be used for control expressions",PL
" One significant difference between Java and many of its predecessors that support object-oriented programming, including C++, is that it is not possible to write stand-alone subprograms in Java",PL
 All Java subprograms are methods and are defined in classes,PL
" Furthermore, methods can be called through a class or object only",PL
" One consequence of this is that while C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, Java supports object-oriented programming only",PL
 Another important difference between C++ and Java is that C++ supports multiple inheritance directly in its class definitions,PL
 Java supports only single ,PL
" inheritance of classes, although some of the benefits of multiple inheritance can be gained by using its interface construct",PL
 Among the C++ constructs that were not copied into Java are structs and unions,PL
" Java includes a relatively simple form of concurrency control through its synchronized modifier, which can appear on methods and blocks",PL
" In either case, it causes a lock to be attached",PL
 The lock ensures mutually exclusive access or execution,PL
" In Java, it is relatively easy to create concurrent processes, which in Java are called threads",PL
" Java uses implicit storage deallocation for its objects, often called garbage collection",PL
 This frees the programmer from needing to delete objects explicitly when they are no longer needed,PL
" Programs written in languages that do not have garbage collection often suffer from what is sometimes called memory leakage, which means that storage is allocated but never deallocated",PL
 This can obviously lead to eventual depletion of all available storage,PL
 Object deallocation is discussed in detail in Chapter 6,PL
" Unlike C and C++, Java includes assignment type coercions (implicit type conversions) only if they are widening (from a â€œsmallerâ€‌ type to a â€œlargerâ€‌ type)",PL
" So int to float coercions are done across the assignment operator, but float to int coercions are not",PL
 The designers of Java did well at trimming the excess and/or unsafe features of C++,PL
" For example, the elimination of half of the assignment coercions that are done in C++ was clearly a step toward higher reliability",PL
 Index range checking of array accesses also makes the language safer,PL
" The addition of concurrency enhances the scope of applications that can be written in the language, as do the class libraries for graphical user interfaces, database access, and networking",PL
" Javaâ€™s portability, at least in intermediate form, has often been attributed to the design of the language, but it is not",PL
 Any language can be translated to an intermediate form and â€œrunâ€‌ on any platform that has a virtual machine for that intermediate form,PL
" The price of this kind of portability is the cost of interpretation, which traditionally has been about an order of magnitude more than execution of machine code",PL
" The initial version of the Java interpreter, called the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM), indeed was at least 10 times slower than equivalent compiled C programs",PL
" However, many Java programs are now translated to machine code before being executed, using Just-in-Time ( JIT) compilers",PL
 This makes the efficiency of Java programs competitive with that of programs in conventionally compiled languages such as C++,PL
 The use of Java increased faster than that of any other programming language,PL
" Initially, this was due to its value in programming dynamic Web documents",PL
" Clearly, one of the reasons for Javaâ€™s rapid rise to prominence is simply that programmers like its design",PL
 Some developers thought C++ was simply too large and complex to be practical and safe,PL
" Java offered them an alternative that has much of the power of C++, but in a simpler, safer language",PL
 Another reason is that the compiler/interpreter system for Java is free and easily obtained on the Web,PL
 Java is now widely used in a variety of different applications areas,PL
" The most recent version of Java, Java 7, appeared in 2011",PL
" Since its beginning, many features have been added to the language, including an enumeration class, generics, and a new iteration construct",PL
" The Perl language, developed by Larry Wall, was originally a combination of sh and awk",PL
" Perl has grown significantly since its beginnings and is now a powerful, although still somewhat primitive, programming language",PL
" Although it is still often called a scripting language, it is actually more similar to a typical imperative language, since it is always compiled, at least into an intermediate language, before it is executed",PL
" Furthermore, it has all the constructs to make it applicable to a wide variety of areas of computational problems",PL
" Perl has a number of interesting features, only a few of which are mentioned in this chapter and later discussed in the book",PL
 Variables in Perl are statically typed and implicitly declared,PL
" There are three distinctive namespaces for variables, denoted by the first character of the variablesâ€™ names",PL
" All scalar variable names begin with dollar signs ($), all array names begin with at signs (@), and all hash names (hashes are briefly described below) begin with percent signs (%)",PL
 This convention makes variable names in programs more readable than those of any other programming language,PL
 Perl includes a large number of implicit variables,PL
" Some of them are used to store Perl parameters, such as the particular form of newline character or characters that are used in the implementation",PL
 Implicit variables are commonly used as default parameters to built-in functions and default operands for some operators,PL
" The implicit variables have distinctiveâ€”although crypticâ€” names, such as $! and @_",PL
" The implicit variablesâ€™ names, like the user-defined variable names, use the three namespaces, so $! is a scalar",PL
 Perlâ€™s arrays have two characteristics that set them apart from the arrays of the common imperative languages,PL
" First, they have dynamic length, meaning that they can grow and shrink as needed during execution",PL
" Second, arrays can be sparse, meaning that there can be gaps between the elements",PL
"The syntax, or form, of the elements of a language has a significant effect on the readability of programs",PL
 Following are some examples of syntactic design choices that affect readability: ,PL
Special words,PL
" Program appearance and thus program readability are strongly influenced by the forms of a languageâ€™s special words (for example, while, class, and for)",PL
" Especially important is the method of forming compound statements, or statement groups, primarily in control constructs",PL
 Some languages have used matching pairs of special words or symbols to form groups,PL
 C and its descendants use braces to specify compound statements,PL
" All of these languages suffer because statement groups are always terminated in the same way, which makes it difficult to determine which group is being ended when an end or a right brace appears",PL
 Fortran 95 and Ada make this clearer by using a distinct closing syntax for each type of statement group,PL
" For example, Ada uses end if to terminate a selection construct and end loop to terminate a loop construct",PL
" This is an example of the conflict between simplicity that results in fewer reserved words, as in C++, and the greater readability that can result from using more reserved words, as in Ada",PL
 Another important issue is whether the special words of a language can be used as names for program variables,PL
" If so, the resulting programs can be very confusing",PL
" For example, in Fortran 95, special words, such as Do and End, are legal variable names, so the appearance of these words in a program may or may not connote something special",PL
  Form and meaning,PL
 Designing statements so that their appearance at least partiallyindicates their purpose is an obvious aid to readability,PL
" Semantics, or meaning, should follow directly from syntax, or form",PL
" In some cases, this principle is violated by two language constructs that are identical or similar in appearance but have different meanings, depending perhaps on context",PL
" In C, for example, the meaning of the reserved word static depends on the context of its appearance",PL
" If used on the definition of a variable inside a function, it means the variable is created at compile time",PL
" If used on the definition of a variable that is outside all functions, it means the variable is visible only in the file in which its definition appears; that is, it is not exported from that file",PL
" One of the primary complaints about the shell commands of UNIX (Raymond, 2004) is that their appearance does not always suggest their function",PL
" For example, the meaning of the UNIX command grep can be deciphered only through prior knowledge, or perhaps cleverness and familiarity with the UNIX editor, ed",PL
 The appearance of grep connotes nothing to UNIX beginners,PL
" (In ed, the command /regular_expression/ searches for a substring that matches the regular expression",PL
" Preceding this with g makes it a global command, specifying that the scope of the search is the whole file being edited",PL
 Following the command with p specifies that lines with the matching substring are to be printed,PL
" So g/regular_expression/p, which can obviously be abbreviated as grep, prints all lines in a file that contain substrings that match the regular expression",PL
 The basic architecture of computers has had a profound effect on language design,PL
" Most of the popular languages of the past 50 years have been designed around the prevalent computer architecture, called the von Neumann architecture, after one of its originators, John von Neumann (pronounced â€œvon Noymanâ€‌)",PL
 These languages are called imperative languages,PL
" In a von Neumann computer, both data and programs are stored in the same memory",PL
" The central processing unit (CPU), which executes instructions, is separate from the memory",PL
" Therefore, instructions and data must be transmitted, or piped, from memory to the CPU",PL
 Results of operations in the CPU must be moved back to memory,PL
 Nearly all digital computers built since the 1940s have been based on the von Neumann architecture,PL
" Because of the von Neumann architecture, the central features of imperative languages are variables, which model the memory cells; assignment statements, which are based on the piping operation; and the iterative form of repetition, which is the most efficient way to implement repetition on this architecture",PL
" Operands in expressions are piped from memory to the CPU, and the result of evaluating the expression is piped back to the memory cell represented by the left side of the assignment",PL
 Iteration is fast on von Neumann computers because instructions are stored in adjacent cells of memory and repeating the execution of a section of code requires only a branch instruction,PL
" This efficiency discourages the use of recursion for repetition, although recursion is sometimes more natural",PL
 The execution of a machine code program on a von Neumann architecture computer occurs in a process called the fetch-execute cycle,PL
" As stated earlier, programs reside in memory but are executed in the CPU",PL
 Each instruction to be executed must be moved from memory to the processor,PL
 The address of the next instruction to be executed is maintained in a register called the program counter,PL
" Another kind of language, the visual language, is a subcategory of the imperative languages",PL
 The most popular visual languages are the ,PL
NET languages,PL
 These languages (or their implementations) include capabilities for drag-and-drop generation of code segments,PL
" Such languages were once called fourth-generation languages, although that name has fallen out of use",PL
 The visual languages provide a simple way to generate graphical user interfaces to programs,PL
" For example, using Visual Studio to develop software in the ",PL
"NET languages, the code to produce a display of a form control, such as a button or text box, can be created with a single keystroke",PL
 These capabilities are now available in all of the ,PL
NET languages,PL
 Some authors refer to scripting languages as a separate category of programming languages,PL
" However, languages in this category are bound together more by their implementation method, partial or full interpretation, than by a common language design",PL
" The languages that are typically called scripting languages, among them Perl, JavaScript, and Ruby, are imperative languages in every sense",PL
 A logic programming language is an example of a rule-based language,PL
" In an imperative language, an algorithm is specified in great detail, and the specific order of execution of the instructions or statements must be included",PL
" In a rule-based language, however, rules are specified in no particular order, and the language implementation system must choose an order in which the rules are used to produce the desired result",PL
 This approach to software development is radically different from those used with the other two categories of languages and clearly requires a completely different kind of language,PL
" Prolog, the most commonly used logic programming language, and logic programming are discussed",PL
 The programming language evaluation criteria described in Section 1,PL
3 provide a framework for language design,PL
" Unfortunately, that framework is self-contradictory",PL
" In his insightful paper on language design, Hoare (1973) stated that â€œthere are so many important but conflicting criteria, that their reconciliation and satisfaction is a major engineering task",PL
â€‌ Two criteria that conflict are reliability and cost of execution,PL
" For example, the Java language definition demands that all references to array elements be checked to ensure that the index or indices are in their legal ranges",PL
 This step adds a great deal to the cost of execution of Java programs that contain large numbers of references to array elements,PL
" C does not require index range checking, so C programs execute faster than semantically equivalent Java programs, although Java programs are more reliable",PL
 The designers of Java traded execution efficiency for reliability,PL
" As another example of conflicting criteria that leads directly to design trade-offs, consider the case of APL",PL
 APL includes a powerful set of operators for array operands,PL
" Because of the large number of operators, a significant number of new symbols had to be included in APL to represent the operators",PL
" Also, many APL operators can be used in a single, long, complex expression",PL
" One result of this high degree of expressivity is that, for applications involving many array operations, APL is very writable",PL
" Indeed, a huge amount of computation can be specified in a very small program",PL
 Another result is that APL programs have very poor readability,PL
 A compact and concise expression has a certain mathematical beauty but it is difficult for anyone other than the programmer to understand,PL
 Well-known author Daniel McCracken (1970) once noted that it took him four hours to read and understand a four-line APL program,PL
 The designer of APL traded readability for writability,PL
 The conflict between writability and reliability is a common one in language design,PL
" The pointers of C++ can be manipulated in a variety of ways, which supports highly flexible addressing of data",PL
" Because of the potential reliability problems with pointers, they are not included in Java",PL
" Examples of conflicts among language design (and evaluation) criteria abound; some are subtle, others are obvious",PL
 It is therefore clear that the task of choosing constructs and features when designing a programming language requires many compromises and trade-offs,PL
 The machine language of the computer is its set of instructions,PL
" In the absence of other supporting software, its own machine language is the only language that most hardware computers â€œunderstand",PL
"â€‌ Theoretically, a computer could be designed and built with a particular high-level language as its machine language, but it would be very complex and expensive",PL
" Furthermore, it would be highly inflexible, because it would be difficult (but not impossible) to use it with other high-level languages",PL
 The more practical machine design choice implements in hardware a very low-level language that provides the most commonly needed primitive operations and requires system software to create an interface to programs in higher-level languages,PL
 A language implementation system cannot be the only software on a computer,PL
" Also required is a large collection of programs, called the operating system, which supplies higher-level primitives than those of the machine language",PL
" These primitives provide system resource management, input and output operations, a file management system, text and/or program editors, and a variety of other commonly needed functions",PL
" Because language implementation systems need many of the operating system facilities, they interface with the operating system rather than directly with the processor (in machine language)",PL
 The operating system and language implementations are layered over the machine language interface of a computer,PL
" These layers can be thought of as virtual computers, providing interfaces to the user at higher levels",PL
" For example, an operating system and a C compiler provide a virtual C computer",PL
" With other compilers, a machine can become other kinds of virtual computers",PL
 Most computer systems provide several different virtual computers,PL
 User programs form another layer over the top of the layer of virtual computers,PL
 The layered view of a computer is shown in Figure 1,PL
2,PL
" The implementation systems of the first high-level programming languages, constructed in the late 1950s, were among the most complex software systems of that time",PL
" In the 1960s, intensive research efforts were made to understand and formalize the process of constructing these high-level language implementations",PL
" The greatest success of those efforts was in the area of syntax analysis, primarily because that part of the implementation process is an application of parts of automata theory and formal language theory that were then well understood",PL
" ML (MetaLanguage; Ullman, 1998) was originally designed in the 1980s by Robin Milner at the University of Edinburgh as a metalanguage for a program verification system named Logic for Computable Functions (LCF; Milner et al",PL
", 1990)",PL
" ML is primarily a functional language, but it also supports imperative programming",PL
" Unlike LISP and Scheme, the type of every variable and expression in ML can be determined at compile time",PL
 Types are associated with objects rather than names,PL
 Types of names and expressions are inferred from their context,PL
" Unlike LISP and Scheme, ML does not use the parenthesized functional syntax that originated with lambda expressions",PL
" Rather, the syntax of ML resembles that of the imperative languages, such as Java and C++",PL
" Miranda was developed by David Turner (1986) at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England, in the early 1980s",PL
" Miranda is based partly on the languages ML, SASL, and KRC",PL
" Haskell (Hudak and Fasel, 1992) is based in large part on Miranda",PL
" Like Miranda, it is a purely functional language, having no variables and no assignment statement",PL
 Another distinguishing characteristic of Haskell is its use of lazy evaluation,PL
 This means that no expression is evaluated until its value is required,PL
 This leads to some surprising capabilities in the language,PL
 Caml (Cousineau et al,PL

 ALGOL 60 was the result of efforts to design a universal programming language for scientific applications,PL
" By late 1954, the Laning and Zierler algebraic system had been in operation for over a year, and the first report on Fortran had been published",PL
" Fortran became a reality in 1957, and several other high-level languages were being developed",PL
" Most notable among them were IT, which was designed by Alan Perlis at Carnegie Tech, and two languages for the UNIVAC computers, MATH-MATIC and UNICODE",PL
 The proliferation of languages made program sharing among users difficult,PL
" Furthermore, the new languages were all growing up around single architectures, some for UNIVAC computers and some for IBM 700-series machines",PL
" In response to this blossoming of machine-dependent languages, several major computer user groups in the United States, including SHARE (the IBM scientific user group) and USE (UNIVAC Scientific Exchange, the large-scale UNIVAC scientific user group), submitted a petition to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) on May 10, 1957, to form a committee to study and recommend action to create a machine-independent scientific programming language",PL
" Although Fortran might have been a candidate, it could not become a universal language, because at the time it was solely owned by IBM",PL
" Previously, in 1955, GAMM (a German acronym for Society for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) had formed a committee to design one universal, machine-independent algorithmic language",PL
 The desire for this new language was in part due to the Europeansâ€™ fear of being dominated by IBM,PL
" By late 1957, however, the appearance of several high-level languages in the United States convinced the GAMM subcommittee that their effort had to be widened to include the Americans, and a letter of invitation was sent to ACM",PL

" The Smalltalk world is populated by nothing but objects, from integer constants to large complex software systems",PL
 All computing in Smalltalk is done by the same uniform technique: sending a message to an object to invoke one of its methods,PL

" The syntax of Smalltalk is unlike that of most other programming language, in large part because of the use of messages, rather than arithmetic and logic expressions and conventional control statements",PL
 One of the Smalltalk control constructs is illustrated in the example in the next subsection,PL
 Smalltalk has done a great deal to promote two separate aspects of computing,PL
"DAPLEX is the best known functional database model, developed by Shipman [Shipman81]",PL
" It is based on the concepts of entities and mappings, where entities represent the basic objects in the system, as types in the database, and the arrows (mappings) are functions from one entity, or a group of entities, to a (possibly single valued) set of entities, thereby representing attributes in an object",PL
" Although DAPLEX is not really a programming language, it was included in this review because it is a database query language, based on functions and function composition",PL
" The entity type can be readily visualised as a category, and function handling in DAPLEX should be equivalent to what is needed for a categorical database",PL
" The original DAPLEX, as devised by Shipman, has been extended, initially by Kulkarni and Atkinson, and is now known as EFDM [Kulkarni86], Extended Functional Data Model",PL
" A noticeable omission of DAPLEX was its inability to attach a â€کgeneral computationâ€™ function to one of the arrows, i",PL
" although attributes were defined as functions, they were really nothing more than relationships, as no general computation other than those supported by the DBMS could be made",PL
" EFDM added limited facilities for supporting general purpose computations, including PS-Algol [Kulkarni87] features in their self-contained EFDM system [Kulkarni86], as well as facilities for specifying integrity constraints and for handling named views of databases",PL
" Later extensions, by Dayal [Dayal89] and by Gray [Gray88], to the DAPLEX language, added more general functions to the language",PL
" Dayal devised OODAPLEX, an extension of DAPLEX, which also incorporated some object-oriented concepts, but the technique with which functions could be utilised was not very â€کfunctionalâ€™",PL
" Gray also added object-oriented concepts as well as general purpose functions into EFDM in a much more natural manner than was already supported, so that, for example, a method could act on two different entity types, for instance (grade(Student,Course)) is in essence a join of the two entities Student and Course, something which OODAPLEX could not do",PL
" This is a very useful concept for a categorical system to have, as it is equivalent to the arrow concept in category theory",PL
 Their system is known as P/FDM,PL
" The P/FDM system is embedded in SICStus Prolog [SICStus93], with very close integration into Prolog, so that a database can be defined in both Prolog and DAPLEX terms, providing a computationally complete query system",PL
 Another useful concept of DAPLEX is that queries can be closed,PL
 A FOR EACH statement allows four possible types of return result,PL
" The result can be printed to the screen, another query can be nested within it, or the result may be an UPDATE statement, as defined in the language syntax [Gray88, Shipman81], or even a general purpose language statement in a language in which DAPLEX is embedded",PL
 For Gofer [Jones94] is a version of Haskell [Hudak92],PL
" Its main differences are that it is interpretative rather than compiled, and incorporates constructor classes, which allow a class to have more than one type constructor",PL
 Current category theory systems have usually been implemented in functional languages,PL
 Rydeheard et,PL
" [Rydeheard88, Dennis-Jones93] have looked at implementing categorical features as types in ML, and 6 Duponcheel [Duponcheel94] has produced an experimental prelude defining categories in Gofer",PL
 Both of these systems have problems though,PL
" Dennis-Jones and Rydeheard acknowledge that the polymorphic type system of ML is too restrictive to express general categorical structures [Dennis-Jones93], a problem that most functional languages would have",PL
 Their system also does not allow families of categories (i,PL
" a category of categories), because the ML type system will not allow recursive type definitions such as this",PL
" irect from the creators of the Javaâ„¢ programming language, the completely revised fourth edition of The Javaâ„¢ Programming Language is an indispensable resource for novice and advanced programmers alike",PL

" The front end of innovationâ€”those activities that take place to generate and nurture ideas before they enter the formal product development processâ€”has been recognized as chaotic, unpredictable, and poorly structured in comparison to the new product development and commercialization process ( Backman, Bأ¶rjesson, and Setterberg 2007 ; Crawford and Di Benedetto 2008 )",PL
" Scholars generally agree that improving performance in the front end offers the greatest potential for improving fi rmsâ€™ innovation capability ( Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1987 ; Smith and Reinertsen 1991 ; Zhang and Doll 2001 ; Verworn, Herstatt, and Nagahira 2008 )",PL

 Understanding the front end of innovation remains a challenge for management researchers and practitioners alike,PL
" Approaches to handling the front end of innovation have focused on strategy ( Khurana and Rosenthal 1997 ), structure ( Markham and Lee 2013 ; Reinertsen 1999 ), metrics ( Smith, Herbein, and Morris 1999 ; Buggie 2002 ), information technology (Gordon et al",PL

" In one of the few well-substantiated theoretical models offered to date, Koen and colleagues (2001)deconstruct the front end into fi ve key components, moving from identifi cation of an opportunity and its analysis to its development and maturation into concrete ideas, one of which is eventually transformed into a formal concept defi ned in business terms",PL
 This model is valuable because it provides clarity and a common language for the front end and thus serves to reduce the fuzziness associated with it,PL
" However, scholars who have explored the front end have done so without reference to underlying community structures",PL
" Generally speaking, communities are a key source of the creativity that powers the front end",PL
" As Drazin, Glynn, and Kazanjian (1999)put it, â€œcreative processes at the organizational level may not simply aggregate from individual or group efforts; rather, they may emerge from a process of negotiating multiple and potentially competing interests between different communities or groups within the organization (e",PL

" A host of studies demonstrate the benefi ts created by several types of communities within and around fi rms, including communities of practitioners ( Constant 1984 , 1987 ), epistemic communities ( Cowan, David, and Foray 2000 ; Cohendet and Meyer-Krahmer 2001 ), communities of practice ( Brown and Duguid 1991 , 2001 ; Lave and Wenger 1991 ; Wenger 1998 ; Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder 2002 ), communities of specialists ( Cohendet and Simon 2007 ), communities of creation ( Sawnhey and Prandelli 2000 ), communities of innovation ( Lynn, Reddy, and Aram 1996 ; Lynn, Aram, and Reddy 1997 ), communities of knowing ( Boland and Tenkasi 1995 ), knowledge-based communities ( David and Foray 2003 ), learning communities ( Bogenrieder and Nooteboom 2003 ), occupational communities ( Bechky 2003 ), and user communities ( von Hippel 1986 , 2001 )",PL

"While the phrase system-of-systems is commonly seen, there is less agreement on what they are, how they may be distinguished from conventional systems, or how their development differs from other systems",SYS
" This paper proposes a definition, a limited taxonomy, and a basic set of architecting principles to assist in their design",SYS
" As it turns out, the term systemof-systems is infelicitous for the taxonomic grouping",SYS
 The grouping might be better termed collaborative systems,SYS
" The paper also discusses the value of recognizing the classification in system design, and some of the problems induced by misclassification",SYS
 One consequence of the classification is the identification of principal structuring heuristics for system-of-systems,SYS
" Another is an understanding that, in most cases, the architecture of a system-of-systems is communications",SYS
" The architecture is nonphysical, it is the set of standards that allow meaningful communication among the components ",SYS
" While the term system-of-systems has no widely accepted definition, the notion is widespread and generally recognized",SYS
 There is an emergent class of systems that are built from components which are large-scale systems in their own right,SYS
" Prominent existing examples include integrated air defense networks, the Internet, and enterprise information networks",SYS
" Much larger, more complex and distributed examples are being planned",SYS
" Notable among them are intelligent transport systems [IVHS America, 1992; USDOT, 1995], military C4I and Integrated Battlespace [Butler et al",SYS
" 1996], global satellite networks [Stuart, 1996], and partially autonomous flexible manufacturing systems [Hayes, 1988]",SYS
"1 The question addressed by this paper is whether or not there is a useful taxonomic distinction between various complex, large-scale systems that are commonly referred to as systems-of-systems",SYS
" For there to be a useful taxonomic distinction, we should be able to divide systems of interest into two (or more) classes such that the members of each class share distinct attributes, and whose design, development, or operations pose distinct demands",SYS
" This paper argues that there is a useful taxonomic distinction, and that the distinction is based on the operational and managerial independence of the systems components",SYS
" By the tenets of this paper, a system would be termed a system-of-  systems or a collaborative system when: (1) Its components) fulfilled valid purposes in their own right and continued to operate to fulfill those purposes if disassembled from the overall system, and (2) the components systems are managed (at least in part) for their own purposes rather than the purposes of the whole",SYS
" Moreover, this paper argues that the commonly cited characteristics of systems-of-systems (complexity of the component systems and geographic distribution) are not the appropriate taxonomic classifiers",SYS
 The principal reason is that there are design guidelines that address those demands that apply differently for systems within and without the proposed class,SYS
" Within these properties are further taxonomic divisions, although they carry less importance in development",SYS
" For example, there is a distinction between collaborative systems that are organized and managed to express particular functions or purposes, and those in which desired behaviors must emerge through voluntary and collaborative interaction without central direction",SYS
" Many problems in developing systems-of-systems can be traced to misclassification, either as to monolithic system versus system-of-systems or as to category within system-of-systems",SYS
" The misclassification issues are related to enabling and fostering collaboration, not to provisions for geographic distribution or complexity issues",SYS
 Especially important is a failure to architect for robust collaboration when direct control is impossible,SYS
 This arises when the developers believe they have greater control over the evolution of the system-of-systems than they actually do,SYS
 In believing this they may fail to ensure that critical properties or elements will be incorporated by failing to provide a mechanism matched to the problem,SYS
 The independence and extent of these aggregations of systems results in an even greater emphasis on interface design than in traditional system architecting and engineering,SYS
" Since the components are often developed independently of the aggregate, the aggregate emerges as a system in its own right only through the interaction of the components",SYS
" Because elements will be independently developed and operated, the system-of-systems architect must express an overall structure largely (or even wholly) through the specification of communication standards",SYS
 Systems-of-systems are largely defined by interface standards,SYS
" Generally, these will be communication protocol standards, possibly at many levels of a layered communication model",SYS
 Only in special cases will there be more concrete interfaces,SYS
 Different problems require interface standards at different levels,SYS
" Some applications, an intelligent transport example stands out, can require a unique standard built from physical transmission upward",SYS
" As data communication becomes ubiquitous, however, the standards that enable each particular system-of-systems will be high-level standards, operating above the transport layer, which define the semantic content of messages passed among the components",SYS
" These standards, sometimes referred to as middleware, will most likely be built on distributed object and messaging frameworks",SYS
" Some cases, military systems for example, may define part of their architecture through human training and indoctrination",SYS
  This analysis of systems-of-systems architecting divides into eight parts,SYS
" The first part reviews some literature discussions of system-of-systems and introduces two commonly cited examples, integrated air defense systems and the Internet",SYS
" Second, the paper provides a two-part core definition for system-of-systems viewed as a taxonomic node",SYS
" Third, the paper examines several design heuristics that are of special importance in systems meeting the definition",SYS
" Fourth, an argument is framed for the taxonomic node and the examples are reexamined in light of the heuristics in the fifth part",SYS
" This part also introduces a future example of a systemof-systems, the Intelligent Transport Systems",SYS
" Sixth, we examine some additional taxonomic division",SYS
 In the seventh part we examine the impact of misclassification (which furthers the overall argument),SYS
" Lastly, the design heuristics and past experience are combined to consider communications as the architecture2 of a system-of-systems",SYS
"  While the term System of Systems appears frequently, there is no widely accepted definition of its meaning",SYS
 The use of a separate term system-of-systems implies a taxonomic grouping,SYS
 It implies the existence of distinct classes within systems,SYS
" Such classes are useful for engineering only if they represent distinct demands in design, development, or operation",SYS
" In a formal sense, system-of-systems is not descriptive",SYS
 A system is generally understood to be an assemblage of components that produces behavior or function not available from any component individually,SYS
" Under this definition, a personal computer is a system",SYS
" The computerآ’s disk drive, video monitor, processor, and so forth are likewise systems",SYS
" So also, formally, a personal computer is a system-of-systems because it is an assemblage of components that are individually regarded as systems",SYS
" Thus, formally, the term systemof-systems has no distinguishing power",SYS
" Its broad use, however, is suggestive that investigators have found value in distinguishing very large and distributed systems from much less complex and more compact systems",SYS
" System-of-systems, as commonly used, suggests assemblages of components that are themselves significantly complex, enough so that they may be regarded as systems and that are assembled into a larger system",SYS
" Many authors, however, prefer the notion of geographic distribution to a notion of a type of interrelationship",SYS
" At least two previous authors have proposed taxonomies that carry the notion of a distinct class of systems generally characterized as large, complex, geographically distributed, and composed of components that are significant systems in their own right",SYS
" Shenhar [1994, p",SYS
 268] proposed a two-dimensional system taxonomy that includes a category called an array,SYS
"  Similarly, Eisner [1993] defines systems-of-systems as large geographically distributed assemblages, but envisions only centrally directed development efforts in which the component systems and their integration are deliberately, and centrally, planned for a particular purpose",SYS
 Thus both Shenhar and Eisner use the term system-of-systems to describe geographically distributed systems which are otherwise developed and managed conventionally,SYS
 Shenhar does make distinctions in best practices for development for what he calls an array that differ from best practices for nondistributed systems,SYS
" However, in all of these cases the development and operations management model is fundamentally centralized",SYS
 Shenhar comes closest to making a case for a useful taxonomic node by discovering best practices different from those associated with his other taxonomic nodes,SYS
" However, neither geographic distribution nor the complexity of components meets the test of being discriminating characteristics for distinctly different design approaches, when the appropriate examples are considered",SYS
 A number of important existing and emerging systems are not characterized by central management of either development or operations,SYS
" These systems are commonly, though not always, geographically distributed and evolutionary",SYS
 What is unique about them is their fundamentally collaborative rather than directed structure,SYS
" These systems are composed of subsystems that are capable of operating independently of the integrated whole, and do operate in partial independence as part of normal operations",SYS
" The integrated system exists because of deliberate decisions by the subsystem or component developers to collaborate as part of a greater whole, and that decision to collaborate is an ongoing one",SYS
 Another term sometimes used for collaborative assemblages is federated system,SYS
 The next sections consider wide area communication networks and integrated air defense systems,SYS
 Wide Area Networks All wide area network systems are geographically distributed and have complex components,SYS
" Hence, they fit the common usage of system-of-systems",SYS
" Major examples include IBM System Network Architecture (SNA), the Bell telephone system, Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks, and the Internet",SYS
" However, these examples are distinguished by the degree of centralization of control in their design and operation",SYS
 The Internet is the classic example of distributed control and operation,SYS
" The central architecture of the Internet, in the sense of an organizing or cohering structure, is a set of protocols now called TCP/IP",SYS
 The TCP/IP family protocols are based on distributed operation and management,SYS
" All data are encapsulated in packets, which are independently forwarded through the Internet",SYS
 Routing decisions are made locally at each routing node,SYS
 Each routing node develops its own estimate of the connection state of the system through the exchange of routing messages (also encapsulated at IP packets),SYS
" The distributed estimate of connection state are not, and need not be consistent or complete",SYS
 Forwarding is designed to be acceptably successful even when connection state estimates are inconsistent and incomplete,SYS
" The distributed nature of routing information, and the memoryless forwarding, allows the Internet to operate without central control or direction",SYS
 A decentralized development community matches this decentralized architecture,SYS
 There is no central body with coercive power to issue or enforce standards,SYS
" The development community creates standards through collaborative arrangements, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and related bodies, and deploys them in a similar fashion",SYS
" The telephone system, and the SNA computer networking system, in contrast, rely on centralized control over operation and development",SYS
 They can also more efficiently utilize transmission technologies or more efficiently carry out specific applications since they can tie directly to them,SYS
 Nodes in the system are centrally directed in maintaining consistent and complete connection state models,SYS
" Instead of memoryless packet forwarding, these networks use end-to-end connection abstractions",SYS
" They also tie more closely to both the transmission technology and user application, and derive efficiency from doing so",SYS
 Comparison of the three example systems (and a further comparison to ATM) reveals the important interplay between distributed operation and development,SYS
 The Internet can be developed in a collaborative way largely because its operation is collaborative,SYS
" Because the Internet uses best-effort forwarding and distributed routing, it can easily offer new services without changing the underlying protocols",SYS
 Those new services can be implemented and deployed by groups that have no involvement in developing or operating the underlying protocols; but only so long as those new services do not require any new underlying services,SYS
" So, for example, groups were able to develop and deploy IP-Phone (a voice over the Internet application) without any cooperation from TCP/IP developers or even Internet service providers",SYS
" However, the IP-Phone application cannot offer any quality of service guarantees since the protocols it is built on do not offer simultaneous delay and error rate bounding",SYS
 The two system types differ in their robustness against accidental and deliberate attack,SYS
" In principle, a decentralized system like the Internet should be less vulnerable to destructive collective phenomena and be able to locally adapt around problems",SYS
" In practice, both the Internet with its distributed control model and the telephone system with its greater centralization have proven vulnerable to collective phenomena",SYS
" It turns out that distributed control protocols like TCP/IP are very prone to collective phenomena in both transmission and routing [Bertsekas and Gallager, 1992: Chap 6]",SYS
 Careful design and selection of parameters has been necessary to avoid network collapse phenomena,SYS
 One reason is that the Internet uses a good intentions model for distributed control which is vulnerable to nodes that misbehave either accidentally or deliberately,SYS
" There are algorithms known which are robust against bad intentions faults, but they have not been incorporated into network designs",SYS
 Wide area telephone blackouts have attracted media attention and shown that the more centralized model is also vulnerable,SYS
" The argument about decentralized versus centralized fault tolerance has a long history in the electric power industry, and even today has not reached full resolution",SYS
 The ATM standard tries to combine characteristics of both centralized and decentralized architecture,SYS
" It adopts packet forwarding as the transfer model, but uses virtual circuit switching for the forwarding rule, which requires networkwide consistency on all connections",SYS
 The ambition for ATM has been to combine the best features of both the computer and telephone networking worlds and offer a rich set of services including both guaranteed and best effort services,SYS
"While the phrase system-of-systems is commonly seen, there is less agreement on what they are, how they may be distinguished from conventional systems, or how their development differs from other systems",SYS

" Hence, they fit the common usage of system-of-systems",SYS
" Major examples include IBM System Network Architecture (SNA), the Bell telephone system, Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks, and the Internet",SYS
" However, these examples are distinguished by the degree of centralization of control in their design and operation",SYS
 The Internet is the classic example of distributed control and operation,SYS
" The central architecture of the Internet, in the sense of an organizing or cohering structure, is a set of protocols now called TCP/IP",SYS
 The TCP/IP family protocols are based on distributed operation and management,SYS
" All data are encapsulated in packets, which are independently forwarded through the Internet",SYS
 Routing decisions are made locally at each routing node,SYS
 Each routing node develops its own estimate of the connection state of the system through the exchange of routing messages (also encapsulated at IP packets),SYS
" The distributed estimate of connection state are not, and need not be consistent or complete",SYS
 Forwarding is designed to be acceptably successful even when connection state estimates are inconsistent and incomplete,SYS
" The distributed nature of routing information, and the memoryless forwarding, allows the Internet to operate without central control or direction",SYS
 A decentralized development community matches this decentralized architecture,SYS
 There is no central body with coercive power to issue or enforce standards,SYS
" The development community creates standards through collaborative arrangements, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and related bodies, and deploys them in a similar fashion",SYS
" The telephone system, and the SNA computer networking system, in contrast, rely on centralized control over operation and development",SYS
 They can also more efficiently utilize transmission technologies or more efficiently carry out specific applications since they can tie directly to them,SYS
 Nodes in the system are centrally directed in maintaining consistent and complete connection state models,SYS
" Instead of memoryless packet forwarding, these networks use end-to-end connection abstractions",SYS
" They also tie more closely to both the transmission technology and user application, and derive efficiency from doing so",SYS
 Comparison of the three example systems (and a further comparison to ATM) reveals the important interplay between distributed operation and development,SYS
 The Internet can be developed in a collaborative way largely because its operation is collaborative,SYS
" Because the Internet uses best-effort forwarding and distributed routing, it can easily offer new services without changing the underlying protocols",SYS
 Those new services can be implemented and deployed by groups that have no involvement in developing or operating the underlying protocols; but only so long as those new services do not require any new underlying services,SYS
" So, for example, groups were able to develop and deploy IP-Phone (a voice over the Internet application) without any cooperation from TCP/IP developers or even Internet service providers",SYS
" However, the IP-Phone application cannot offer any quality of service guarantees since the protocols it is built on do not offer simultaneous delay and error rate bounding",SYS
 The two system types differ in their robustness against accidental and deliberate attack,SYS
" In principle, a decentralized system like the Internet should be less vulnerable to destructive collective phenomena and be able to locally adapt around problems",SYS
" In practice, both the Internet with its distributed control model and the telephone system with its greater centralization have proven vulnerable to collective phenomena",SYS
" It turns out that distributed control protocols like TCP/IP are very prone to collective phenomena in both transmission and routing [Bertsekas and Gallager, 1992: Chap 6]",SYS
 Careful design and selection of parameters has been necessary to avoid network collapse phenomena,SYS
 One reason is that the Internet uses a good intentions model for distributed control which is vulnerable to nodes that misbehave either accidentally or deliberately,SYS
" There are algorithms known which are robust against bad intentions faults, but they have not been incorporated into network designs",SYS
 Wide area telephone blackouts have attracted media attention and shown that the more centralized model is also vulnerable,SYS
" The argument about decentralized versus centralized fault tolerance has a long history in the electric power industry, and even today has not reached full resolution",SYS
 The ATM standard tries to combine characteristics of both centralized and decentralized architecture,SYS
" It adopts packet forwarding as the transfer model, but uses virtual circuit switching for the forwarding rule, which requires networkwide consistency on all connections",SYS
 The ambition for ATM has been to combine the best features of both the computer and telephone networking worlds and offer a rich set of services including both guaranteed and best effort services,SYS
Software Engineering Tutorial delivers basic and advanced concepts of Software Engineering,SE
 Software Engineering Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals both,SE
Software Engineering provides a standard procedure to design and develop a software,SE
"Our Software Engineering Tutorial contains all the topics of Software Engineering like Software Engineering Models, Software Development Life Cycle, Requirement Engineering, Software Design tools, Software Design Strategies, Software Design levels, Software Project Management, Software Management activities, Software Management Tools, Software Testing levels, Software Testing approaches, Quality Assurance Vs",SE
" Quality control, Manual Testing, Software Maintenance, Software Re-engineering and Software Development Tool such as CASE Tool",SE
What is Software Engineering?,SE
"The term software engineering is the product of two words, software, and engineering",SE
 The software is a collection of integrated programs,SE
Software subsists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by developers on any of various particular computer languages,SE
"Computer programs and related documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals",SE
"Engineering is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, processes, etc",SE
"Software Engineering is an engineering branch related to the evolution of software product using well-defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures",SE
 The result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product,SE
Why is Software Engineering required?,SE
Software Engineering is required due to the following reasons,SE
To manage Large software,SE
For more Scalability,SE
Cost Management,SE
To manage the dynamic nature of software,SE
For better quality Management,SE
Need of Software Engineering,SE
The necessity of software engineering appears because of a higher rate of progress in user requirements and the environment on which the program is working,SE
Huge Programming,SE
" It is simpler to manufacture a wall than to a house or building, similarly, as the measure of programming become extensive engineering has to step to give it a scientific process",SE
Adaptability,SE
" If the software procedure were not based on scientific and engineering ideas, it would be simpler to re-create new software than to scale an existing one",SE
Cost: As the hardware industry has demonstrated its skills and huge manufacturing has let down the cost of computer and electronic hardware,SE
 But the cost of programming remains high if the proper process is not adapted,SE
Dynamic Nature,SE
 The continually growing and adapting nature of programming hugely depends upon the environment in which the client works,SE
" If the quality of the software is continually changing, new upgrades need to be done in the existing one",SE
Quality Management,SE
 Better procedure of software development provides a better and quality software product,SE
The importance of Software engineering is as follows,SE
Reduces complexity,SE
 Big software is always complicated and challenging to progress,SE
 Software engineering has a great solution to reduce the complication of any project,SE
 Software engineering divides big problems into various small issues,SE
 And then start solving each small issue one by one,SE
 All these small problems are solved independently to each other,SE
To minimize software cost,SE
Software needs a lot of hardwork and software engineers are highly paid experts,SE
 A lot of manpower is required to develop software with a large number of codes,SE
" But in software engineering, programmers project everything and decrease all those things that are not needed",SE
" In turn, the cost for software productions becomes less as compared to any software that does not use software engineering method",SE
To decrease time,SE
Anything that is not made according to the project always wastes time,SE
" And if you are making great software, then you may need to run many codes to get the definitive running code",SE
" This is a very time-consuming procedure, and if it is not well handled, then this can take a lot of time",SE
" So if you are making your software according to the software engineering method, then it will decrease a lot of time",SE
"Handling big projects,Big projects are not done in a couple of days, and they need lots of patience, planning, and management",SE
" And to invest six and seven months of any company, it requires heaps of planning, direction, testing, and maintenance",SE
" No one can say that he has given four months of a company to the task, and the project is still in its first stage",SE
 Because the company has provided many resources to the plan and it should be completed,SE
" So to handle a big project without any problem, the company has to go for a software engineering method",SE
Reliable software,SE
"Software should be secure, means if you have delivered the software, then it should work for at least its given time or subscription",SE
" And if any bugs come in the software, the company is responsible for solving all these bugs",SE
" Because in software engineering, testing and maintenance are given, so there is no worry of its reliability",SE
Effectiveness,SE
 Effectiveness comes if anything has made according to the standards,SE
 Software standards are the big target of companies to make it more effective,SE
 So Software becomes more effective in the act with the help of software engineering,SE
Software Project Planning,SE
"A Software Project is the complete methodology of programming advancement from requirement gathering to testing and support, completed by the execution procedures, in a specified period to achieve intended software product",SE
Need of Software Project Management,SE
"Software development is a sort of all new streams in world business, and there's next to no involvement in structure programming items",SE
 Most programming items are customized to accommodate customer's necessities,SE
 The most significant is that the underlying technology changes and advances so generally and rapidly that experience of one element may not be connected to the other one,SE
" All such business and ecological imperatives bring risk in software development; hence, it is fundamental to manage software projects efficiently",SE
Software Project Manager,SE
Software manager is responsible for planning and scheduling project development,SE
 They manage the work to ensure that it is completed to the required standard,SE
 They monitor the progress to check that the event is on time and within budget,SE
" The project planning must incorporate the major issues like size & cost estimation scheduling, project monitoring, personnel selection evaluation & risk management",SE
" To plan a successful software project, we must understand",SE
Scope of work to be completed,SE
Risk analysis,SE
The resources mandatory,SE
The project to be accomplished,SE
Record of being followed,SE
Software Project planning starts before technical work start,SE
 The various steps of planning activities are,SE
 Software Processes,SE
"The term software specifies to the set of computer programs, procedures and associated documents (Flowcharts, manuals, etc",SE
) that describe the program and how they are to be used,SE
A software process is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a software product,SE
 Software engineers mostly carry out these activities,SE
" These are four key process activities, which are common to all software processes",SE
 These activities are:Software specifications,SE
The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined,SE
Software development,SE
The software to meet the requirement must be produced,SE
Software validation,SE
 The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants,SE
Software evolution,SE
 The software must evolve to meet changing client needs,SE
The Software Process Model,SE
"A software process model is a specified definition of a software process, which is presented from a particular perspective",SE
" Models, by their nature, are a simplification, so a software process model is an abstraction of the actual process, which is being described",SE
" Process models may contain activities, which are part of the software process, software product, and the roles of people involved in software engineering",SE
 Some examples of the types of software process models that may be produced are:,SE
"A workflow model: This shows the series of activities in the process along with their inputs, outputs and dependencies",SE
 The activities in this model perform human actions,SE
" A dataflow or activity model: This represents the process as a set of activities, each of which carries out some data transformations",SE
" It shows how the input to the process, such as a specification is converted to an output such as a design",SE
 The activities here may be at a lower level than activities in a workflow model,SE
 They may perform transformations carried out by people or by computers,SE
 A role/action model: This means the roles of the people involved in the software process and the activities for which they are responsible,SE
There are several various general models or paradigms of software development,SE
"The waterfall approach: This takes the above activities and produces them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on",SE
" After each stage is defined, it is ""signed off"" and development goes onto the following stage",SE
"Evolutionary development: This method interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation",SE
 An initial system is rapidly developed from a very abstract specification,SE
"Formal transformation: This method is based on producing a formal mathematical system specification and transforming this specification, using mathematical methods to a program",SE
 These transformations are 'correctness preserving,SE
' This means that you can be sure that the developed programs meet its specification,SE
System assembly from reusable components: This method assumes the parts of the system already exist,SE
 The system development process target on integrating these parts rather than developing them from scratch,SE
Software Crisis,SE
Size: Software is becoming more expensive and more complex with the growing complexity and expectation out of software,SE
" For example, the code in the consumer product is doubling every couple of years",SE
"Quality: Many software products have poor quality, i",SE
", the software products defects after putting into use due to ineffective testing technique",SE
" For example, Software testing typically finds 25 errors per 1000 lines of code",SE
Cost: Software development is costly i,SE
 in terms of time taken to develop and the money involved,SE
" For example, Development of the FAA's Advanced Automation System cost over $700 per lines of code",SE
Delayed Delivery: Serious schedule overruns are common,SE
" Very often the software takes longer than the estimated time to develop, which in turn leads to cost shooting up",SE
" For example, one in four large-scale development projects is never completed",SE
Program vs,SE
 Software,SE
Software is more than programs,SE
" Any program is a subset of software, and it becomes software only if documentation & operating procedures manuals are prepared",SE
There are,SE
Program: Program is a combination of source code & object code,SE
Documentation: Documentation consists of different types of manuals,SE
" Examples of documentation manuals are: Data Flow Diagram, Flow Charts, ER diagrams, etc",SE
 Operating Procedures: Operating Procedures consist of instructions to set up and use the software system and instructions on how react to the system failure,SE
" Example of operating system procedures manuals is: installation guide, Beginner's guide, reference guide, system administration guide, etc",SE
" The software is used extensively in several domains including hospitals, banks, schools, defense, finance, stock markets, and so on",SE
 It can be categorized into different types,SE
System Software â€“System Software is necessary to manage the computer resources and support the execution of application programs,SE
" Software like operating systems, compilers, editors and drivers, etc",SE
", come under this category",SE
 A computer cannot function without the presence of these,SE
 Operating systems are needed to link the machine-dependent needs of a program with the capabilities of the machine on which it runs,SE
 Compilers translate programs from high-level language to machine language,SE
 Application Software â€“ Application software is designed to fulfill the userâ€™s requirement by interacting with the user directly,SE
 It could be classified into two major categories:- generic or customized,SE
 Generic Software is the software that is open to all and behaves the same for all of its users,SE
 Its function is limited and not customized as per the changing requirements of the user,SE
" However, on the other hand, Customized software the software products which are designed as per the clientâ€™s requirement, and are not available for all",SE
Networking and Web Applications Software â€“ Networking Software provides the required support necessary for computers to interact with each other and with data storage facilities,SE
 The networking software is also used when software is running on a network of computers (such as the World Wide Web),SE
" It includes all network management software, server software, security and encryption software, and software to develop web-based applications like HTML, PHP, XML, etc",SE
 Embedded Software â€“This type of software is embedded into the hardware normally in the Read-Only Memory (ROM) as a part of a large system and is used to support certain functionality under the control conditions,SE
" Examples are software used in instrumentation and control applications like washing machines, satellites, microwaves, etc",SE
" Reservation Software â€“A Reservation system is primarily used to store and retrieve information and perform transactions related to air travel, car rental, hotels, or other activities",SE
" They also provide access to bus and railway reservations, although these are not always integrated with the main system",SE
" These are also used to relay computerized information for users in the hotel industry, making a reservation and ensuring that the hotel is not overbooked",SE
 Business Software â€“ This category of software is used to support business applications and is the most widely used category of software,SE
" Examples are software for inventory management, accounts, banking, hospitals, schools, stock markets, etc",SE
" Entertainment Software â€“Education and entertainment software provides a powerful tool for educational agencies, especially those that deal with educating young children",SE
" There is a wide range of entertainment software such as computer games, educational games, translation software, mapping software, etc",SE
" Artificial Intelligence Software â€“Software like expert systems, decision support systems, pattern recognition software, artificial neural networks, etc",SE
 come under this category,SE
 They involve complex problems which are not affected by complex computations using non-numerical algorithms,SE
 Scientific Software â€“ Scientific and engineering software satisfies the needs of a scientific or engineering user to perform enterprise-specific tasks,SE
" Such software is written for specific applications using principles, techniques, and formulae specific to that field",SE
" Examples are software like MATLAB, AUTOCAD, PSPICE, ORCAD, etc",SE
" Utilities Software â€“ The programs coming under this category perform specific tasks and are different from other software in terms of size, cost, and complexity",SE
" Examples are anti-virus software, voice recognition software, compression programs, etc",SE
" Document Management Software â€“ Document Management Software is used to track, manage and store documents in order to reduce the paperwork",SE
 Such systems are capable of keeping a record of the various versions created and modified by different users (history tracking),SE
" They commonly provide storage, versioning, metadata, security, as well as indexing and retrieval capabilities",SE
 On the basis of copyright,SE
"Commercial â€“It represents the majority of software which we purchase from software companies, commercial computer stores, etc",SE
" In this case, when a user buys software, they acquire a license key to use it",SE
 Users are not allowed to make copies of the software,SE
 The copyright of the program is owned by the company,SE
" Shareware â€“ Shareware software is also covered under copyright but the purchasers are allowed to make and distribute copies with the condition that after testing the software, if the purchaser adopts it for use, then they must pay for it",SE
" In both of the above types of software, changes to the software are not allowed",SE
" Freeware â€“ In general, according to freeware software licenses, copies of the software can be made both for archival and distribution purposes but here, distribution cannot be for making a profit",SE
 Derivative works and modifications to the software are allowed and encouraged,SE
 Decompiling of the program code is also allowed without the explicit permission of the copyright holder,SE
" Public DomainIn the case of public domain software, the original copyright holder explicitly relinquishes all rights to the software",SE
 Hence software copies can be made both for archival and distribution purposes with no restrictions on distribution,SE
 Modifications to the software and reverse engineering are also allowed,SE

The classical waterfall model is the basic software development life cycle model,SE
 It is very simple but idealistic,SE
 Earlier this model was very popular but nowadays it is not used,SE
 But it is very important because all the other software development life cycle models are based on the classical waterfall model,SE
The classical waterfall model divides the life cycle into a set of phases,SE
 This model considers that one phase can be started after the completion of the previous phase,SE
 That is the output of one phase will be the input to the next phase,SE
 Thus the development process can be considered as a sequential flow in the waterfall,SE
 Here the phases do not overlap with each other ,SE
 Feasibility Study: The main goal of this phase is to determine whether it would be financially and technically feasible to develop the software,SE
The feasibility study involves understanding the problem and then determining the various possible strategies to solve the problem,SE
" These different identified solutions are analyzed based on their benefits and drawbacks, The best solution is chosen and all the other phases are carried out as per this solution strategy",SE
 Requirements analysis and specification: The aim of the requirement analysis and specification phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and document them properly,SE
 This phase consists of two different activities,SE
 Requirement gathering and analysis: Firstly all the requirements regarding the software are gathered from the customer and then the gathered requirements are analyzed,SE
 The goal of the analysis part is to remove incompleteness (an incomplete requirement is one in which some parts of the actual requirements have been omitted) and inconsistencies (an inconsistent requirement is one in which some part of the requirement contradicts some other part),SE
Requirement specification: These analyzed requirements are documented in a software requirement specification (SRS) document,SE
 SRS document serves as a contract between the development team and customers,SE
 Any future dispute between the customers and the developers can be settled by examining the SRS document,SE
Design: The goal of this phase is to convert the requirements acquired in the SRS into a format that can be coded in a programming language,SE
 It includes high-level and detailed design as well as the overall software architecture,SE
 A Software Design Document is used to document all of this effort (SDD),SE
Coding and Unit testing: In the coding phase software design is translated into source code using any suitable programming language,SE
 Thus each designed module is coded,SE
 The aim of the unit testing phase is to check whether each module is working properly or not,SE
 Integration and System testing: Integration of different modules are undertaken soon after they have been coded and unit tested,SE
 Integration of various modules is carried out incrementally over a number of steps,SE
" During each integration step, previously planned modules are added to the partially integrated system and the resultant system is tested",SE
" Finally, after all the modules have been successfully integrated and tested, the full working system is obtained and system testing is carried out on this",SE
 System testing consists of three different kinds of testing activities as described below ,SE
Alpha testing: Alpha testing is the system testing performed by the development team,SE
Beta testing: Beta testing is the system testing performed by a friendly set of customers,SE
"Acceptance testing: After the software has been delivered, the customer performed acceptance testing to determine whether to accept the delivered software or reject it",SE
Maintenance: Maintenance is the most important phase of a software life cycle,SE
 The effort spent on maintenance is 60% of the total effort spent to develop a full software,SE
 There are basically three types of maintenance,SE
Corrective Maintenance: This type of maintenance is carried out to correct errors that were not discovered during the product development phase,SE
Perfective Maintenance: This type of maintenance is carried out to enhance the functionalities of the system based on the customerâ€™s request,SE
Adaptive Maintenance: Adaptive maintenance is usually required for porting the software to work in a new environment such as working on a new computer platform or with a new operating system,SE
Advantages of Classical Waterfall Model,SE
The classical waterfall model is an idealistic model for software development,SE
" It is very simple, so it can be considered the basis for other software development life cycle models",SE
 Below are some of the major advantages of this SDLC modeL,SE
This model is very simple and is easy to understand,SE
Phases in this model are processed one at a time,SE
Each stage in the model is clearly defined,SE
This model has very clear and well-understood milestones,SE
"Process, actions and results are very well documented",SE
Reinforces good habits: define-before- design,SE
design-before-code,SE
This model works well for smaller projects and projects where requirements are well understood,SE
Drawbacks of Classical Waterfall ModeL,SE
"The classical waterfall model suffers from various shortcomings, basically, we canâ€™t use it in real projects, but we use other software development lifecycle models which are based on the classical waterfall model",SE
 Below are some major drawbacks of this model,SE
No feedback path: In the classical waterfall model evolution of software from one phase to another phase is like a waterfall,SE
 It assumes that no error is ever committed by developers during any phase,SE
" Therefore, it does not incorporate any mechanism for error correction",SE
" Difficult to accommodate change requests: This model assumes that all the customer requirements can be completely and correctly defined at the beginning of the project, but actually customersâ€™ requirements keep on changing with time",SE
 It is difficult to accommodate any change requests after the requirements specification phase is complete,SE
 No overlapping of phases: This model recommends that a new phase can start only after the completion of the previous phase,SE
" But in real projects, this canâ€™t be maintained",SE
" To increase efficiency and reduce cost, phases may overlap",SE
" Spiral model is one of the most important Software Development Life Cycle models, which provides support for Risk Handling",SE
" In its diagrammatic representation, it looks like a spiral with many loops",SE
 The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from project to project,SE
 Each loop of the spiral is called a Phase of the software development process,SE
 The exact number of phases needed to develop the product can be varied by the project manager depending upon the project risks,SE
" As the project manager dynamically determines the number of phases, so the project manager has an important role to develop a product using the spiral model",SE
" The Radius of the spiral at any point represents the expenses(cost) of the project so far, and the angular dimension represents the progress made so far in the current phase",SE
" Objectives determination and identify alternative solutions: Requirements are gathered from the customers and the objectives are identified, elaborated, and analyzed at the start of every phase",SE
 Then alternative solutions possible for the phase are proposed in this quadrant,SE
"Identify and resolve Risks: During the second quadrant, all the possible solutions are evaluated to select the best possible solution",SE
 Then the risks associated with that solution are identified and the risks are resolved using the best possible strategy,SE
" At the end of this quadrant, the Prototype is built for the best possible solution",SE
"Develop next version of the Product: During the third quadrant, the identified features are developed and verified through testing",SE
" At the end of the third quadrant, the next version of the software is available",SE
"Review and plan for the next Phase: In the fourth quadrant, the Customers evaluate the so far developed version of the software",SE
" In the end, planning for the next phase is started",SE
Risk Handling in Spiral Model,SE
A risk is any adverse situation that might affect the successful completion of a software project,SE
 The most important feature of the spiral model is handling these unknown risks after the project has started,SE
 Such risk resolutions are easier done by developing a prototype,SE
 The spiral model supports coping up with risks by providing the scope to build a prototype at every phase of the software development,SE
" The Prototyping Model also supports risk handling, but the risks must be identified completely before the start of the development work of the project",SE
" But in real life project risk may occur after the development work starts, in that case, we cannot use the Prototyping Model",SE
" In each phase of the Spiral Model, the features of the product dated and analyzed, and the risks at that point in time are identified and are resolved through prototyping",SE
" Thus, this model is much more flexible compared to other SDLC models",SE
 Why Spiral Model is called Meta Model?,SE
The Spiral model is called a Meta-Model because it subsumes all the other SDLC models,SE
" For example, a single loop spiral actually represents the Iterative Waterfall Model",SE
 The spiral model incorporates the stepwise approach of the Classical Waterfall Model,SE
 The spiral model uses the approach of the Prototyping Model by building a prototype at the start of each phase as a risk-handling technique,SE
" Also, the spiral model can be considered as supporting the Evolutionary model â€“ the iterations along the spiral can be considered as evolutionary levels through which the complete system is built",SE
 Advantages of Spiral Model,SE
Below are some advantages of the Spiral Model,SE
" Risk Handling: The projects with many unknown risks that occur as the development proceeds, in that case, Spiral Model is the best development model to follow due to the risk analysis and risk handling at every phase",SE
Good for large projects: It is recommended to use the Spiral Model in large and complex projects,SE
Flexibility in Requirements: Change requests in the Requirements at later phase can be incorporated accurately by using this model,SE
"Customer Satisfaction: Customer can see the development of the product at the early phase of the software development and thus, they habituated with the system by using it before completion of the total product",SE
Disadvantages of Spiral Model,SE
Below are some main disadvantages of the spiral model,SE
 Complex: The Spiral Model is much more complex than other SDLC models,SE
Expensive: Spiral Model is not suitable for small projects as it is expensive,SE
Too much dependability on Risk Analysis: The successful completion of the project is very much dependent on Risk Analysis,SE
" Without very highly experienced experts, it is going to be a failure to develop a project using this model",SE
"Difficulty in time management: As the number of phases is unknown at the start of the project, so time estimation is very difficult",SE
